                        "value": "**A narrative for the young based on the lesson’s text**\n\n**Day 1- Genesis 38:1-11**\n\n\"I am out of here!\" Judah shouted when he could no longer see his father's tent. He was headed down into the valley to join his friend Hirah and shepherd his flocks among the Canaanites. Judah's newfound freedom made each step feel lighter than the one before it. Jacob's suffering over the loss of Joseph was more than Judah could bear. Watching his father grieve day in and day out only made the burden of guilt seem heavier. The heavier it got, the more he wanted to run away from his family and everything that reminded him of Joseph. The favor that Judah was once so envious of had lost its luster. What Judah thought he could gain from Joseph's disappearance was now tainted with his blood. So, his interest in inheriting his father's blessing was no longer something he desired. The shame over what he had done to his own brother had taken its toll and left him no other choice in his own mind than to leave everything and everyone behind. \n\n\"Welcome, my friend!\" Hirah said, throwing his arm around Judah's shoulder. Judah smiled broadly at his friend. Hirah's warm and unrestrained personality always seemed to help ease the burden of guilt he carried. \"Let's give your sheep some water and head into Adullam to find some entertainment,\" Hirah said with a wink. \nJudah laughed, \"You sure do know how to have fun.”\n\nThat night and many nights after, Judah and Hirah drank too much wine and met too many Canaanite women. It was an easy distraction for Judah and kept his mind from wandering back to his family. The one thing it didn't do was fill the emptiness inside him. Despite his distractions, his flocks multiplied, and his prominence amongst the Canaanite people. Although it did not bring the peace, he longed for.\n\nOne day, Judah, while doing business with a man called Shua, Judah caught sight of Shua's daughter. One look at this mysterious woman, and he convinced himself he had to have her. However, Jacob knew that taking this Canaanite to be his wife would put him even further from his family. Memories of his father instructing him and his brothers not to marry Canaanite women surfaced, but he quickly shoved them aside. By the end of his business meeting, he had asked Shua for his daughter, Mehetabel, and paid the bride price. \n\nA temporary peace settled in Judah's heart in the early years with Mehetabel. She quickly bore him two sons, Er and Onan. Eventually, they moved to Chezib and dwelled near Mehetabel's father, Shua. Shua taught Judah's sons all about the worship of the Canaanite gods, Baal and Asherah. As well as the abundant harvests that came from the fertility festivals. Then, Mehetabel gave birth to a third son named Shelah. \n\nWhen Er had grown, Judah went to a prominent friend of Shua's who had a granddaughter named Tamar. He chose her to be Er's wife, but it was not a happy marriage from the beginning. So consumed by wickedness, Er spent little time at home. Judah sensed that his son treated Tamar more as a slave than a wife. When Er was away, Judah told Tamar stories of his father and the God he served. Much of it was painful to recount, but Tamar was curious, and it was hard to resist her innocent questions. Their friendly conversations were interrupted when Er's servant returned with his coat covered in blood one day. \n\n\"He was devoured by a lion,\" the servant explained to Judah.\nSpeechless, Judah stood motionless, with the coat in his arms. He could not escape the memory of his father grasping a similar coat belonging to Joseph. He began to weep, not only for the death of his own son but also for the tremendous grief he had caused his own father. \n\nWhen Judah finally faced the reality that his son was gone forever, he spoke to Tamar. \"Your time with Er was short; therefore, you have no children to carry on the inheritance. It is the custom that I give you to Er's brother, Onan, as a wife. Then he can raise up children for his brother.”\n\nTamar had an ever-growing desire to learn more about Judah's heritage. She had an unexplainable interest in knowing about this God named, Yahweh whom Judah's father served. So, when Judah gave her to Onan, she was desperate for children to secure her place in the family. Tamar assumed Onan would be different from Er. He had always been friendly towards her. Even treating her with more respect than her first husband. However, as time went on, the brothers were not so different. Onan refused to give her children. He had no desire to raise children who would ultimately be given his older brother's inheritance. He wanted the inheritance for himself. Just like Er, Onan spent most of his time away. Once again, Judah found himself sitting around the fire telling his daughter-in-law the stories of his family. \"Tell me the story of Bethel again,\" she would plead. Or she would ask him what Paddam Aram was like. Sometimes her questions brought up memories of Shechem or his brother Joseph, and he would fall quiet and tell her to go get her work done. But Tamar always returned the next day asking about Yahweh and his promise to Judah's father.\n\nYears had passed, and Onan had still not given Tamar a child. Then tragedy struck again when Onan was killed in a hunting accident. This time Judah's reaction was different. He looked grieved but scared at the same time. \n\"What is happening? How could I lose two sons, and neither of them has given me an heir?\" he thought to himself, \"this woman is a curse to my family.\" After Judah buried Onan, he told Tamar, \"My youngest son is not yet old enough to marry. You should go and live in your father's house until he is old enough.\" In his heart, he knew he could not lose another son. Until he could figure out a way to free Shelah from this marriage, he would do what he could to keep Tamar away from him. \n\nHeartbroken, Tamar packed her things and returned to her father's house. She waited and waited, longing to be brought back into Judah's family, but he never came for her.\n\n1. **Judah left his brothers and moved away. Which group of people did he live amongst?** Judah lived among the Canaanite people.\n2. **Who did Judah take as a wife? What did the Lord think of his actions?** Judah took a Canaanite woman to be his wife. The Lord had told Abraham and Isaac not to marry those women, so it wasn't a good idea for Judah as well.\n3. **In Genesis 49:10, we read ahead to see Jacob blesses Judah as his heir before he dies. Judah will also be the tribe to rule over the nation of Israel. If this was God's plan for him, in what way had Judah wandered so far away from these plans?** Judah went to live among the Canaanites, who lived and worshiped completely opposite of Yahweh and his ways. His Canaanite children would not have followed the paths of God, and the tribe of Judah would have been corrupted from the beginning. \n\n\n**Day 2- Genesis 38:12-19**\n\nYears had passed, and Judah had all but forgotten about Tamar. Not long after she had gone, his wife Mehetabel had become ill. Years had gone by as she suffered and sought healing from the priests of Baal, but nothing they did would bring her relief. In the meantime, his son Shelah had grown up, but Judah had no intention of giving Tamar to him as a wife. Besides, Shelah was content to be with the women serving Baal under the sacred tree like his brothers. \n\nEventually, Mehetabel died, and Judah mourned once again. \"How could I lose two sons and now a wife? Is my family cursed?\" he said to himself. \n\nHis friend, Hirah visited Judah weekly, attempting to comfort him. One morning, Hirah arrived and said in his usual jolly tone, \"Pack your things, Judah. It's time you got out and had some fun. We go up to Timnah to see the sheepshearers and join in the festivities. I heard the wine this year is going to be excellent! It will be great fun.”\n\nSo, Judah dressed in his best robes, tied the cord around his neck that held his signet, and picked up his staff. His days of mourning were over, he decided as he adjusted the cord that held one of his most important possessions. During his grief, he had left the precious signet next to his bed. It felt good to have it around his neck once more, identifying his prominent position amongst the Canaanites. He looked at his staff as well, rubbing his thumb over the familiar etchings. A symbol of his authority, he never went anywhere without it. \n\nAs Hirah and Judah rode out of the city that day, Tamar's mother happened to be near the city gate. When she saw Judah, her daughter's estranged father-in-law, headed to shear his sheep, she went to her quickly with the news. \n\"Tamar, this is your chance,\" her mother said. \"Your chance to get a husband and be taken care of. When your father dies, you will not survive here. Judah has no intention of giving you to Shelah. You've waited long enough. You must take matters into your own hands. Follow Judah to Timnah; many women will be there who work in the temple; you can dress as one of them and deceive him into making you his wife.”\n\nTamar stood before her mother, dressed in the typical clothing meant for widows. The garments were dreary-looking years ago when she had begun to wear them after the death of her first husband. Now they seemed barely fit for a slave. As Tamar looked down at her attire that had complimented her despair so well over the years, a flicker of hope began to grow within her. It had almost been snuffed out when it was clear that Judah no longer wanted her in the family. However, she had worn her widow's clothing every day, desperate to be a part of her father-in-law's clan. It was his God, Yahweh, who drew her. She wanted to secure her place among his people.\n\n\"Yes, Mother, I will go. But it's not just about getting a husband and tricking him into giving me a child. I want my place in Judah's family and for my future children as well,\" Tamar explained.\n\"Well, you must hurry then!\" \n\nTamar removed her dingy clothes and wrapped herself in the clothing fit for a temple woman. Then she headed out of the city as quickly as she could, crossing the valley to get ahead of Judah and his companions. Finally, she arrived at the entrance to Enaim along the road to Timnah. Finding a stone to sit upon, Tamar covered herself with a veil to disguise her face and sat outside the city's gate.\n\nIt wasn't long before Judah, and his friend came along. Tamar caught his attention, and Judah was immediately drawn to her.\n\n\"Go on ahead, Hirah. I will meet you later,\" he told his friend.\n\nWhen Hirah had gone, Judah said to Tamar, \"I would like to have you.\"\n\n\"What can you give me in return?\" she asked him with a hauntingly familiar voice.\n\n\"I will send you a young goat from my flock when I reach them at Timnah.\"\n\n\"How do I know you will really send a goat? Give me something of yours to keep until you send the goat. I want a guarantee that you will do as you promise,\" Tamar said to him.\n\n\"Okay, what should I give you?\" he asked.\n\nTamar looked at the signet dangling from his neck, \"I will take your signet with the cord and your staff. When you send me the goat, I will return them to you,\" she explained.\n\nJudah nodded, lifted his precious signet over his head, and placed it in her hand. The engraving upon it signified his identity and position. He hoped he wasn't making a mistake. Then he passed her his staff. \nAs she set it down next to her, she smiled, pleased that things were going as planned. They spent the evening together, but before the sun rose, Tamar returned home to her widow's clothing and patiently waited to see if her plans had worked.\n\n\n1. **Where was Judah heading with his friend, Hirah, the Adullamite?** Judah and Hirah were going to watch the sheep be sheared. The Canaanite culture typically involved pagan rituals and other festivities that involved temple prostitutes.\n 2. **Why was Tamar so desperate to have a child with Judah?** We don't know Tamar's true motives, but it could be that she was drawn to Judah's God, Yahweh, and his family's reputation. She saw the value in being a part of it. Having a child would solidify her place, providing an heir for Judah.\n3. **Were Judah and Tamar's actions sinful?** Yes, both Judah and Tamar acted out of their desires to get what they wanted. But God took something wicked and used it for his good purposes.\n\n\n**Day 3- Genesis 38:20-26**\n\nThe next day, Judah asked Hirah to deliver the goat he had promised, \"I need to get back my signet and staff. Will you bring the goat to the woman who was along the roadside in exchange for the things I pledged?”\n\nHirah agreed, but when he got the entrance of Enaim, she was nowhere to be found. He searched the roadside in and out of town, but there was no sign of her. When he returned to the entrance, he recognized a merchant selling rings for the temple worship. \"Where is the woman who works in the temple? She was here yesterday,\" he asked.\n\n\"You must be mistaken. There has been no woman here who works in the temple,\" he replied. \tConfused, Hirah gave up his search and went back to Judah, who had remained with his sheepshearers. \"I looked everywhere, but I could not find the woman. The men in Enaim said there hadn't been any temple woman around lately. Who was that woman?\" Hirah asked.\n\nJudah looked rattled and said, \"Let's just forget it. Let her keep my signet, cord, and staff as her own. It's not worth getting laughed at. I did what I promised. I sent the young goat, but she wasn't there.\" \n\nJudah decided to put the situation out of his mind. He celebrated the sheepshearing and returned to his home with Hirah when it was finished. Three months had passed when one of Judah's most trusted servants came to him with news of Tamar. \"I heard she that she had been immoral. Then I saw it with my own eyes, my Lord. She is pregnant!\"\n\"What?!\" Judah shouted, standing to his feet. \"How could she bring such shame upon my household?! She was to remain a widow in her father's home. The punishment for her immorality is death. Bring her out and burn her,\" he announced.\n\nJudah had no intention of seeing her sentence carried out. He was simply relieved that he no longer had to worry about his responsibility to give Tamar to his son, Shelah. So, when his servant returned with more news shortly after, he was more than displeased. \n\n\"My Lord, there is something you must see,\" his servant explained, refusing to look him in the eye. Judah followed his servant through the city to capture his daughter-in-law. A crowd had gathered. When they had pushed their way through, before him stood Tamar, dressed in her old shabby widow's clothing, with a belly that had begun to protrude beneath them. But Judah wasn't looking at that; he was focused on what lay in her outstretched arms. \n\n\"She claims that the father of her child is the man to whom these belong,\" his servant said apprehensively. \"Is this your signet and staff, my lord?\" he asked, taking the staff from Tamar's hand and giving it to Judah for inspection.\nJudah looked at it hesitantly, rubbing his thumb over the familiar etchings. His face paled, \"How could this be?\" he asked himself under his breath. Judah looked up into Tamar's stoic eyes. Was she the temple woman by the road? How could he have not recognized her? \n\n\"This is mine,\" he announced, unable to take his eyes from Tamar. She came toward him, and with her wrists still tied, she took the cord of his signet and placed it around his neck. Judah looked down at the cylinder that marked his identity. \n\n\"You promised to give me your son, Shelah,\" Tamar said quietly. \"I only wanted to provide you an heir and remain a part of your family. Your God promised to bless your offspring. I believe him.”\n\nJudah looked at his poor daughter-in-law, finally noticing her old widow's clothes. She had been waiting all this time to be brought back into the family like he had promised. Judah fell to his knees before her, completely ashamed of what he had done to her. \n\n\"She is more righteous than I,\" he explained to the people surrounding him. \"By law, she had the right to marry my son, and I kept her from him.\" Judah no longer cared if the people around him laughed or judged him. He was a broken man. It wasn't only his sin with Tamar that weighed upon him, but the years of guilt he had carried since the slaughter at Shechem and, worst of all, his hatred toward his brother. Suddenly his heart seemed to burst within him, and his tears began to flow. Not only tears of sorrow but tears of repentance. From that moment, he would return to the God of his father. No longer would he run from his family and the promises they had been given. It was Tamar, a simple Canaanite woman, who had taught him how valuable they were.\n\n1. **Why did Tamar take Judah's signet, cord, and staff?** Tamar knew if she became pregnant, it would be the only way to prove that Judah was the father of her child.\n2. **Was Judah sorry for the way he had treated Tamar?** Yes, Judah was humbled by Tamar's desire to hold to what he had promised her. He said, \"she is more righteous than I.\" We know he was genuinely sorry because he turned back to the Lord after that, and his father passed on the blessing to him in Genesis 49:10-12. \n3. **Why did Judah say that Tamar was more righteous than he?** He recognized that Tamar held to the promise that she should be given a chance to produce an heir for the family. \n4. **How far are you willing to go to hold onto what God has promised to those who belong to him?** We should never sin like Tamar did to obtain what God has promised, but we be prepared to strive with him through suffering as he fulfills them.\n\n\n**Day 4- Genesis 38:27-30**\n\nJudah brought Tamar back into his house to live like his daughter-in-law until it was time for her to give birth. When her labor came, Judah waited and waited for the news of his child. When the midwife finally came to him with information, she said, \"Well, you have not one, but two sons. Tamar was carrying twins. Your second son is quite a fighter. The first stuck his hand out as he was about to come out, and I quickly tied a cord around his wrist to recognize him, but then his brother overtook him and came out first.”\n\nThe events of his son's birth reminded Judah of the story his grandfather, Isaac, used to tell him. His uncle, Esau, had been born with his father, Jacob grasping his heel, almost like his two new sons had been born. Even though Jacob was not the firstborn, he fought for his father's blessing and obtained it. Judah kept this in mind and announced their names as Perez and Zerah. \n\n1. **How many sons did Tamar give birth to? Who was the firstborn?** She gave birth to twins. Perez fought through to become the firstborn.\n2. **In Zechariah 10, the Lord promises great things for the tribe of Judah. He promises to make them strong and redeem them. He says that from them will come the cornerstone. Do you know who calls himself the cornerstone?** Jesus is called the cornerstone. He is the stone that the foundation of his church is built upon. Judah and Tamar were the great, great, great,….grandparents of Jesus our Messiah, and he comes from the tribe of Judah.\n3. **The Lord took a man running from him and lost in sin and a woman from a family who worshipped idols to begin the story of his people? What does that tell you about Yahweh?** The Lord takes our brokenness and sin and uses them to make everything work towards his plans and purposes. It shows us how merciful and loving he is towards us. It's comforting to know that his plans don't depend on us, he is the one in control, and we can trust that.\n \n\n**The Lord used Judah and Tamar to demonstrate how firm his promises are. Despite their sin, God used them to carry on the promises to Israel, and from them came the Savior of the world.**\n\n\n\n\n"

But Judah didn’t think the blessing he had been given was very special.\n\nAfter Judah helped sell his little brother Joseph off to Egypt, he decided to move away from his family. He went to live with the Canaanite people. The Canaanite people did not worship The Lord.

We left simply knowing Joseph had been sold to a man named Potiphar. Now the narrative quickly shifts focus onto Judah. Since Joseph is out of the picture, and Jacob's three older sons had sinned against their father, the inheritance fell to Judah. However, it would seem that Judah showed no interest in being the recipient of God's blessing. His move away from his father, and his marriage to a Canaanite woman, was clear evidence that Judah was trying to cut ties with his family and responsibility. The story we read in Chapter thirty-eight runs parallel to the chapters about Joseph that will follow. The two stories merge again in chapter forty-two.  \n\nThe story of Judah is not just about his geographical move away from his father's house. It also highlights the sinfulness of his actions to integrate into Canaanite culture and religion. He raises three sons and even finds a Canaanite wife for Er, his eldest son. After the Lord killed Er for being wicked, Jacob commands his second eldest to take his brother's wife. In ancient times, when a husband died before having children, it became the responsibility of a brother of the deceased to marry his brother's wife and have a child in the brother's name. The practice was known as levirate marriage. [1] However, Judah's second son Onan was not interested in propagating his brother's name. It would seem he would rather have a more significant portion of his father's inheritance for himself. After the Lord killed Onan, Judah superstitiously casts the blame onto his daughter-in-law, Tamar. Instead of keeping her in his home until his third eldest was old enough to marry, he sent her back to her father to live.  \n\n1. What do you think motivated Judah to leave his father's house? \n2. What words and phrases repeat to help frame the theme of this section? \n3. What are some implications in this story for living outside the will and blessings of God? \n\n\n**Genesis 38: 12-30 - God shows Judah mercy**\n\nThe death of Judah's wife marks a pivot in the story, bringing Tamar into a leading role. After a few years, Tamar realizes she is waiting in vain for Judah's youngest son to reach manhood, and decides to take matters into her own hands. Tamar knew what kind of man Judah was and how she could deceive him into sleeping with her. Because Tamar knew that he went to the city to participate in pagan rituals and festivities, she was able to dress up like a temple prostitute and trick him into lying with her. Tamar showed herself to be just as deceptive. Similar to the story of Jacob tricking his father Isaac into giving him the blessing, Tamar also disguises and misleads to get what she wants. Not only was she successful in getting pregnant, but she also acquired three valuable items that would identify Judah as the father. In ancient times, a man's signet ring, staff, and robe were just as good as a modern DNA test. When Judah realized what he had fallen for, he withheld from killing Tamar. It is quite a stretch for us to think that a girl who deceived her father-in-law is called \"righteous.\"  Yet, it is essential to see that Judah compared her actions to his own. Because he was more guilty than she was, he could not condemn her and his children to death for the sins in which he was also complicit. His only way out was to acknowledge his sin and humbly take Tamar as his wife.  \n\nThe story of Judah moves quickly through time. The first 11 verses cover about 20 years. Then time slows down to the last year, before this narrative comes to an end. The final three verses cover only a few hours and focus on the story of the birth of Perez and Zerah. The detail of their birth draws us back to another account of twins being born. Perez means \"Breach\" or \"to push through.\" Born of prostitution and incest to the Canaanite woman Tamar, this son nevertheless came into the messianic line.\n\n1. What words and phrases shape the theme of this section of the passage? \n2. How do Judah's actions seem to pose a threat to the promises of God? \n3. Has there been a time when you have realized that God's mercy has kept you from the consequences of your sin? \n\n\n**Genesis 49: 8-12– God chose the line of Judah**\n\nThe final chapters of Genesis are about Jacob and his descendants. We fast forward now to the end of Jacob's life just before he dies. In this passage, we see clearly why the narrative of Judah is where it is. Before Jacob dies, he blesses each of his sons, with Judah and Joseph receiving the most attention. The blessings portray the future history of each of Jacob's sons. In verses eight to twelve, we see Judah receiving the sign of the lion and the lions' share of the blessing. In this passage, Jacob declares the national prominence and kingship to Judah's line. Both King David and King Solomon come from Judah's line, and so will the ultimate King, \"to whom the scepter belongs.\" The name \"Shiloh\" is the cryptogram for the Messiah, the one who is also called the \"Lion of Judah\". There will be so much abundance that people will tie a donkey to a choice vine, letting it eat because there is such abundance. Wine will be as plentiful as water, and everyone will be healthy. Although there are short moments of fruitful bounty in Israel's history, the language in this text points to a future of permanent blessing and abundance.  \n\n1. What words and phrases in this passage stand out to you? \n2. What contrasts Jacob's blessing of Judah and the story in chapter thirty-eight? \n3. When you consider the story and future of Judah, what reflections do you have about God? \n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n\n**Zechariah 10 – The one for whom God's people wait is Jesus Christ.**\n\nThe overarching story of Israel is one of constant disobedience and failure to obey God's commands. Parallel to this is the steadfast love of God working to fulfill his promises. In this passage, Zechariah is writing to encourage God's people by reminding them of what God has promised them. In Zechariah's day God's people were also undeserving of all that God was promising them, just as Judah was unworthy of the blessings he received through his father.   \n\nZechariah was a priest who, a as young man coming out of captivity, traveled back to Jerusalem to help rebuild the Temple. The kingdom of Judah was conquered by the Babylonian kingdom and sent into exile around 586BC. In 538, Cyrus the Persian King allowed the captives to resettle in their homeland. About 50,000 people returned to the land and began to rebuild the Temple.[4] However, after a short while, neighboring opposition, followed by indifference, left the project abandoned and unfinished. Sixteen years later, the Lord called Zechariah and Haggai to stir the people to rebuild the Temple. As a result, the Temple was completed four years later, in 516 B.C. \n\nIn this passage, Zechariah calls on God’s people to request a blessing from God based on His promises. He wants to encourage the people to finish the Temple, reminding them that God will strengthen and establish Israel. This promise rests on the \"cornerstone,\" another name used to describe Messiah. Christ is the foundation on which His kingdom rests and through whom the promises to Israel will be fulfilled.  In verse five, the prophet pictures foot soldiers overpowering the cavalry in battle. This analogy illustrates the power of God's people when He is with them. This would have been an encouraging reminder for a nation in ruins and still under the boot of a foreign king.  \n\n1.

He told Noah to have many children and then to spread out over the earth. But instead of obeying, most of the people decided to stay together. \n\nThere came a time when these people decided to build a great city with a tower. They worked together building bricks to make this strong tower. Work was hard, but it was easy to work together because they all spoke the same language. They were so proud of what they had accomplished and shouted, “Look at our magnificent tower!”  And everyone did look, including God. He came down and saw their city and their tower, but he did not think it was magnificent because they did not obey him. The Lord said, “If they continue, they will do much more.”\n\nSo, God gave them each their own language and overnight the people of Babel could no longer understand one another. As a result, the building stopped, the city was abandoned, and the tall tower eventually fell and was forgotten. After this the people spread over all the earth as God wanted.\n\n**The people of Babel rebelled against God, so he confused them. But in Jesus Christ, he brings us together. **"

With every other step of his own animal, Abram looked back to check on his ailing father. In the midst of their long journey from Ur, Terah had fallen sick. The long days of travel grew harder on his father and the nights were worse. Terah’s fever would spike, causing him to toss and turn in his sleep. Abram wondered if they would ever make it to the land of Canaan. \n\nHis home of Ur seemed so far away now and very few happy memories remained. The violent death of his little brother, Haran, had left a stain on Ur and the Chaldeans that could never be washed away.  Since the division in the great city of Babel, chaos and violence had plagued their world for generations. Abram’s father had heard stories of Canaan, a rich and abundant land across the great desert, but the trip was long and dangerous. It was the death of Haran that caused his father to finally leave Ur. Now, they were almost halfway through their journey and Abram wasn’t sure if Terah was going to make it. \nAfter crossing a tributary of the Tigris river, Abram, his wife, Sarai, his nephew, Lot, and his father stood at the gates to the city of Haran. Although the stop was unplanned, it was necessary until Terah’s health improved. The gate was opened wide by the city officials who recognized Terah and his entourage, pleased to welcome a man of great wealth and importance. Terah perked up at the honorable reception and forced all of his remaining energy into leading his household to a place where he could rest. \n\n“Abram, take me to the temple,” Terah ordered, as soon as they had settled. “I must make a sacrifice to the gods for healing.”\n\nAbram furloughed his brow and dutifully nodded. He had always been skeptical of the ways of the gods and temple worship, opposed to his father, who was well known in Ur for his dedication and devotion amongst the spiritual leaders. “Father, rest first, then I will take you to see the healers in the temple.” Terah laid down and quickly fell asleep.  So, Abram helped his wife Sarai set Terah’s precious idols around his room and quietly slipped away. \n\n“How long will we stay in Haran?” Sarai asked Abram.\n\n“At least until his fever is gone. He believes the temple healers are the answer, but sadly, I have little faith in their ability to make a difference,” he told her. \n\nIt wasn’t until the next morning that Terah was strong enough to travel to the temple of Haran. Abram called the servants while Terah prepared himself, dressing in his finest robe. Then they lifted him onto a litter and carried him through the streets of Haran towards the temple. In the street, people stopped and stared at the procession, signifying someone of high status. Abram followed, impatient to get to the temple and return so his father could get the rest he needed. \n\nWhen they had arrived, Abram looked up at the giant structure, stairs ascending to the narrow tip and then descending to the ground where he stood. Surprisingly, it wasn’t unlike the temple they had left behind in Ur, both marking the center of everything in the city. The priests met them at the bottom and together they climbed the stairs. When they finally reached the top, the four servants set Terah’s litter down and he went forward with the priests to pray to the gods for healing. Abram waited by his father’s chair, watching them look up at the moon and stars for answers. \n\nAn hour later, Terah returned, completely wasted of energy. He rested next to Abram, looking out across the valley. They could see both the Tigris river and the Euphrates from the top of the temple. “You know Abram,” Terah began. “It wasn’t far from here that the first temple was built in the city of Babel. Not long after the great flood, Nimrod, the great grandson of Noah, united the people of the world. He was a mighty man, a great hunter, but his prey was beyond animals, he hunted men’s souls and then united the people of the Shinar valley, inspiring them to worship the heavens. This is where the great city of Babel originated, the first of many cities Nimrod established under his authority. Eventually, the people came together in one accord to construct the first temple of worship. It all began with an innovative way to make bricks. In those days, bricks were formed with mud and then dried in the sun. So, the people of Shinar tried something new. They started a fire and let it burn until became extremely hot. Then, placing the bricks in the fire, they cooked them until they became like stone. Next, using the tar they had dug from the lakes, they fastened the stone bricks together. With this achievement, they were able to build very strong structures, structures that could be raised higher and higher. They made a name for themselves by the expansion of their glorious city and their renown rose to new heights at the construction of the tower to the gods. Their tremendous unity enabled them to build the highest and greatest temple in order to worship the moon and stars. Remember, this was before the days of division, so people flocked to the city to work together. They shared a common language in those days, so the chaos and confusion we struggle with today was not a problem. The tower was almost completed, and the people of Babel began to make sacrifices to the gods, exalting themselves for all they accomplished. Their pride was warranted, for it was truly only the beginning of a spectacular creation. But, one day the wind began to blow. It began to blow with a supernatural force centered around the tower, as if something had angered the gods. But it wasn’t just the wind that shook people, out of it blew a spirit of confusion and the priests, priestesses, the servants and worshipers on the tower stumbled and fell, completely disoriented. When the wind had died down, they realized they could no longer understand one another. This was true in the city as well. Every family began to speak a new language. This was the great division, a sad day for the city of Babel. The tower eventually crumbled and, as you know, Abram, the city remains abandoned. Some say it was the invisible God who put a stop to the building. They say he came down to see the plans of Babel and stopped it before they continued to build a city that unified all people in rebellion to him. These worshipers of the invisible God say it was an act of mercy. But what kind mercy is that?” Terah grunted. “Causing confusion that leads to dispersion and the destruction of such a superior monument to the heavenly lights. How could that be anything but evil?” \n\nAs Terah spoke, Abram’s mind began to wander, and he remembered again the dream that had come to him while he was still in Ur. In the dream, this invisible God spoke to him, promising him blessings and a future. Then, as quickly as the memory came to him, Abram’s attention was drawn back to the present as Terah motioned the servants to leave. The moon and stars seemed closer than ever atop the temple, but Abram looked beyond them. Where was this invisible God? Did he reside beyond the stars? A need to discover the truth began to grow inside of him that he could not evade that night and for many nights after.\n\nAbram and Sarai remained in Haran at his father’s side, nursing him day and night, but his illness never improved. Finally, after many months, Terah passed away. \n\nAbram didn’t have the motivation to continue on in their journey. It seemed risky. They had settled in Haran, and it had begun to feel like home. Sarai had not yet given him a child, so it would be foolish to jeopardize that by traveling. So, Abram and his nephew Lot remained in Haran. One year turned into another and still Sarai had not fallen pregnant. “Is my wife barren?” Abram found himself asking the invisible God. Since his father’s story of Babel, Abram could not escape the thoughts he had of the God who had been responsible for the great dispersion at Babel and possibly the flood as well. Every evening he would walk by the Tigris and imagine what this invisible God was like, and once again his dream of God speaking to him flowed back into his memory.\n\t\n**Man came together in rebellion against God, so he dispersed them by confusing their language. Hundreds of years later, man came together again, but this time in obedience to God, so he united them in his Spirit, speaking the same language.**"

There is a list of who these decedents are, where they moved, and even the various languages that were attributed to these descendants. It would seem that the family of Noah did exactly what God told them to do, and God was blessing them for their obedience. However, Chapter 11 tells us a different story of how the spread of mankind on the earth came about. Instead of spreading out over the earth, they decided to stay together, defying God’s command. This short story is placed in the narrative of God’s plan to show that sin was still very present in the heart of man, revealing humankind's desire to exalt ourselves, and our lack of trust in and love for God.  \n\n1. How does verse 4 contrast with God’s command in chapter 9 verse 1?\n2. What motivated the people to build a city?\n3. In what ways to do we put more trust in organized religion than in God’s promise?\n\n**Gen 11:5-9 – God causes chaos and confusion when we do things contrary to his will.**\n\nThis tower, or ziggurat, that they were building was not a symbol of their worship of God, but a symbol of their own strength and achievements. The ziggurat, which became a common symbol of Mesopotamian culture and religion, was a step ladder structure, made of mud bricks, whose footprint was square or rectangular. Although the precise meaning of the structure is unknown, the common accepted interpretation was that it served symbolically as a passage between heaven and earth. It was God’s desire that man be unified, but true unity cannot be achieved unless it is on God’s terms. God’s response to their efforts was his way of slowing man’s plunge into the level of rebellion that it had been before the flood. It was also a way to force them to do what they refused to do voluntarily, which was to scatter over the face of the earth. \n\n1. What was God’s response when he saw the city and the tower?\n2. Why did the confusion of languages result in the city being abandoned?\n3. How has the diversity of languages effected communication in our own church and in our world today?\n\n**Gen 11:10-32 – God’s plan of redemption is not spoiled by man’s rebellion. **\n\nIf the story of Genesis ended at the tower of Babel it would be truly a gloomy and hopeless ending to an already frustrating story about man’s ability to fail at everything. However, God wants to make it clear that his plans are not thwarted by humankind’s inability to obey. God’s grace once again supersedes human sin, continuing the possibility of the promises of God.  Man’s self-made structure of pride and exaltation must be broken down in order for God to establish the Shemite line that will culminate in the life and faith of Abraham who would be the beginning of humankind’s deliverance.  \n\n1. How many generations are listed from Shem to Abraham?\n2. What is the difference between the line of Shem written in chapter 10 and his lineage in chapter 11?\n3. Why is there so much emphasis in Genesis on the line of Shem?\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n \n**Acts 2:1-21– The Gospel transcends the boundaries of cultures and languages.**\n\nWhen man attempts to unify on his own terms, God disperses them. Although it is God’s desire that man be unified, true unity must be on his terms. That which the people in Babel wanted to unite around was a far cry from being a people in a right relationship with God and with one another. However, when God decides to unite mankind, he is able to reach people from every tongue tribe and nation. The day of Pentecost was an annual spring feast which followed 7 weeks after Passover. According to tradition, Jewish people who lived within a 20-mile radius were expected to attend this festival. However, since the festival was in late spring, early summer the conditions were favorable for Jewish people from further away to attend the festival. This meant that, although most of the people who were in Jerusalem for the feast were Jewish, they were by no means of the same language or culture. Since the days when Babylon lead Israel into captivity Jewish people remained outside of Israel, mixing their Jewish culture with the culture and languages of the people with whom they lived. What the Spirit of God accomplished on that day was a call, not just for the people of Israel, but for all people everywhere to repent and believe in Jesus the Messiah. From the day of Pentecost, the Gospel has been sent out to all the countries, people groups and languages in the earth to be declared in their own language, and in their own context. When the people of Babel tried to unify without God, God divided their languages and scattered them. When God unifies, he sent his Spirit to divide the tongues of his disciples in order to draw all people to himself. \n\n1. What ability(s) did the Holy Spirit give to the disciples on the Day of Pentecost?\n2. How many nations were listed in this multi-cultural “audience”?\n3.

                        "value": "*Lesson Principle:*    \nGod's plan of redemption is not without suffering.\n\n----------\n\n\n**Genesis 37:1-11 – The one God chooses to lead often experiences jealousy from those who must submit.**\n\nChapter thirty-six sums up the story of Esau's life and the life of his descendants. In comparison, the conclusion of Jacob’s life and his lineage will take up the rest of the narrative in Genesis. Although this is still predominately the story of Jacob, Joseph takes a lead role throughout the majority of this section. In Genesis chapter fifteen, God told Abraham that his descendants would sojourn in a foreign land where they would enter into slavery. This story reveals how the people Moses led out of Egypt ended up there in the first place.\n\nIt is no surprise that Joseph was his father's choice to be the heir of the blessing. Joseph was the firstborn of Jacob's favorite wife and was, therefore, shown overt favoritism. The robe that Jacob gave to Joseph was more than just a lavish gift given to a favorite son. The robe marked Joseph as the one whom Jacob intended to be the future leader of the household; an honor usually given to the firstborn son. As a result, Joseph's brothers hated and envied him.\n\nJoseph freely shared two dreams with his family, thus intensifying their animosity toward him. The second dream he shared even earned him a rebuke from his father. The symbolism of the dreams does not need any special interpretation on our part in order to understand their meaning. It was, however, one more reminder to Joseph's brothers of his elevated position over them.\n \n1. What is significant about Joseph's age?\n2. What was the biggest reason Joseph's brothers hated him?\n3. What are the particulars of Joseph's dreams that stand out to you?\n\n**Genesis 37: 12-24 - A good man will suffer.**\n\nJoseph's brothers were looking for a time and a place to take out their rage on their younger brother. As they see him coming over the hill from Shechem, and being so far from their father, they decide to take advantage of the opportunity. Before Joseph even reaches his brothers, they plot to kill him and blame his death on wild animals. This plan should not come as a surprise since these men had already made their name by plotting and killing the men in Shechem. Note how the brothers point back to Joseph's dreams. Their plan was simple. Kill the dreamer, kill the dreams. If it were not for Reuben and Judah, they would indeed have followed through with it.\n\nAfter they seize Joseph, the first thing they do is take his robe from him. The robe that symbolized his position. They literally stripped him of his title. Since Reuben would not allow them to kill him, they needed time to think, so they threw him in a nearby hole. The pit that they threw Joseph in to was most likely a cistern dug out of a rock to hold water. Moses´ mentioning the fact that it had no water is evidence of this. Once again, the wickedness of Jacob's sons comes to the forefront of the story. This time their wicked hearts are set against their own family.\n\n1. Why do you think Reuben, the eldest brother, was against killing Joseph?\n2. After playing out the entire scenario, what did Joseph's brother stand to gain if they killed their brother?\n3. How does Moses compare and contrast Joseph with the rest of his brothers? Why are these differences so significant to the story?\n\n\n**Genesis 37: 25-36– God preserves his chosen servant.**\n\nSince Reuben foiled their plans to kill Joseph, they needed time to think. The fact that they sat down to eat only speaks to the hatred they had toward their brother. As he lay in a cistern calling for help, they sat down to have a snack. For some reason, Reuben was not with them when they sat down to eat. Perhaps he went away to find a rope to save his brother so he could restore him to Jacob.  \n\nIn Reuben's absence, it seems Judah became the pack leader.\n When the band of Ishmaelites came traveling by, he came up with a brilliant plan. By selling Jospeh to their distant cousins, he would get rid of Joseph without killing him. The Ishmaelites were descendants of Abraham's eldest son, Ishmael. The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah and Midian. These two groups of people probably successfully intermarried, and thus both names are mentioned in the text. The twenty silver pieces that the Midianites paid for Joseph was likely to have been the going rate for a slave in those days. From the perspective of these wicked shepherds, the job was half done. Joseph was gone, and now they just needed to cover their tracks.\n\nAs Judah carried his plan out, Reuben returned and realized he had been foiled. Being the eldest brother, he would be held responsible. After his ordeal with Bilhah, Jacob's concubine, any chance of a restored relationship between Reuben and his father seemed to disappear. He must have felt the only choice he had left was to join his brothers in their plan to deceive their father. Again, Joseph's robe is mentioned. What was once a symbol of Jacob's joy would become the symbol of tremendous grief. So, Jacob's sons successfully deceive their father, Jacob falls into despair, and Joseph is shipped off to Egypt to enter into the service of Potiphar, an officer of Pharoh. At this point, the story about Joseph takes a pause, and Judah, the fourth eldest son of Jacob, is brought into the spotlight.\n\n1. From what we have read, what can we know about Reuben?\n2. What is the significance of the sons of Jacob selling their brother to the Midianites?\n3. Repetition is used a lot in Hebrew writing. It heightens the message, and brings greater emphasis. In light of this, how was Jacob deceived in the same way he had deceived?\n\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n\n**John 15: 18-25 – Because Christ has chosen you, the world will hate you.**\n\nThe life of Joseph provides excellent material for a study on the rejection and suffering of the righteous. Although Joseph's brothers hated him, Moses does not portray Joseph as having done anything wrong. An attempt to show Joseph as a spoiled, arrogant brat is wrong and misplaced. His father chose Joseph to be the heir, and Joseph's dreams gave God's stamp of approval. As a result of the love from his father, Joseph's brothers hated and persecuted him. Joseph, like Jesus, was \"hated without cause.\" The suffering of the saints is woven into God's plan of redemption.\n\nThe misery that Jesus speaks of is precisely the kind that comes from those who oppose the Gospel. The purpose of this teaching is not to cause defeat and despair. On the contrary, Jesus tells us we can take great comfort in suffering, knowing that we suffer because of our identity with Christ. Just as Jacob gave Joseph a coat of many colors, Our Father in heaven dresses us in his righteousness, making us distinct from the world. Although this distinction comes with the potential for suffering, it comes with a more incredible guarantee of joy and union with Christ. And just like Joseph, we must remember that our story does not end in suffering.  \n \n\n1. What is the primary conditional statement Jesus makes in this text?\n2. What are the parallels between the hatred Joseph experienced at the hands of his brothers, and the hatred Christians can experience at the hands of ‘the world’?\n3. In what ways have you ever been disliked or hated for following Jesus?\n\n$$$$$$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Sometimes when we sleep, we see images or experience an event in our mind. Jacob’s son, Joseph had two dreams, however these were no ordinary dreams. These dreams were given to him by the Lord. \n\nJacob had twelve sons and Joseph was his favorite. He loved him so much, he gave him a very special colorful coat. Joseph’s brothers saw his coat and became jealous of the special attention their father gave him. Things got even worse when Joseph told them about his dreams. \n\nHe said to them, “I had a dream that we were gathering wheat into bundles in the field and your bundles bowed down to my bundle.” \n\nWhen they heard this, they weren’t just jealous of Joseph, they hated him. Then Joseph had another dream and said to his father and his brothers, “I had a dream that the sun, moon, and eleven stars bowed down to me.” \n\nThis time his brothers were furious and said, “Are you saying we will all bow down to you as our master?! Never!” they shouted.\n\nNot long after that Joseph’s brothers were far out in the field taking care of the flocks. When Joseph went to check on them, they saw him coming and said, “Here comes that dreamer! Let’s throw him in that hole over there and leave him to die.”\n\nThey grabbed Joseph, stripped him of his coat and dropped him in the deep hole. But Judah stopped them and said, “Wait, we can’t let him die. I see a caravan of traders coming this way. Let’s sell him as a slave.”\n\nSo, Joseph’s brothers hauled him out of the hole, tied him up and sold him to the traders for twenty pieces of silver. When they returned home, they presented Joseph’s coat to their father and said, “He must have been devoured by a wild animal. All that is left is his coat.”\n\nJacob was so sad, he cried for days over Joseph’s death. However, Joseph was not truly dead, he was on his way to Egypt.\n\t\n1. **What did Joseph’s father give to him as a gift?** He gave him a colorful coat.\n2. **What happened in Joseph’s dreams?** Joseph’s brother’s wheat bowed down to his wheat. In the second dream, the sun, moon, and eleven stars bowed down to Joseph. This meant that in the future, his whole family would bow down to him.\n\n**Joseph was hated by his own brothers because the Lord had chosen him for a special purpose. Jesus says that those who follow him will be hated, but, like Joseph, the Lord will use them for a special purpose.**"

                        "value": "**A narrative for the young based on the lesson’s text**\n\n**Day 1 - Genesis 37:1-11**\n\nThe years quickly passed since Jacob had arrived at the home of his father Isaac in Hebron. After losing Rachel, Joseph had become his pride and joy. All his affections had been poured on the oldest son of his most beloved wife. Joseph was a grown man now, yet Jacob’s affections for him had not changed. Joseph was Jacob’s favorite. He reminded Jacob so much of his mother. Jacob taught Joseph everything he knew about Yahweh and his promises. Confident that he would be the one to carry on the birthright and blessing, Jacob gave him responsibility over his older brothers. Unfortunately, this only provoked jealousy amongst his sons and clear contempt for Joseph.  \n\nOne day, Jacob sent Joseph out with Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher to pasture their flock. Joseph had recently been given the responsibility to oversee his brothers as shepherds. Jacob had no choice, since the disaster at Shechem, his sons had been unruly and prone to violence. Their constant need for supervision had exhausted him. So, when Joseph returned from the fields with a report of his brother’s wicked behavior, Jacob wasn’t surprised. Thankfully, he could rely on Joseph to manage them, he was the only one that could be trusted, besides his little brother Benjamin. \n\n“Joseph,” Jacob called to his son. \n\n“Yes, Father, I am here.”  \n\n“I have a gift for you,” Jacob said, holding up a beautiful long cloak. The ornate pattern of colors on the coat were slighted accented by ornamentation along the stitching. Jacob stood back admiring his son. “It is truly fit for a prince!” Jacob exclaimed. \n\n“Thank you, Father. I will not disappoint you,” Joseph smiled proudly.\n\nAs Joseph exited Jacob’s tent, Gad and Asher caught sight of their younger brother wearing his new cloak. “Where did he get that cloak?” Asher asked his brother. “Did Father give it to him?”\n\n“Of course, he got it from Father. Where else would he have gotten it? Don’t you see, Father has marked that self-righteous do-gooder as the possessor of the family birthright,” Gad explained, as the anger boiled within him. \n\t\t \n**Who was Jacob’s favorite son?** Joseph was Jacob’s favorite son. He was the oldest son of his favorite wife, Rachel and the son he had parented with wisdom in his older age.\n\n**What responsibilities did Jacob give to his son Joseph?** Joseph was a shepherd like his brothers, but Jacob gave him authority over them to make sure they shepherded the flocks well. He was their overseer.\n\n**What did Joseph’s new cloak look like? What did the cloak symbolize?** The coat was made of many colors. It symbolized Joseph’s position as the favorite chosen son. It very possibly could have meant that Jacob had chosen Jacob to inherit the birthright and blessing, eventually putting him the place of highest authority over his brothers.\n\n**Day 2 - Genesis 37:5-11**\n\nIt wasn’t only Gad and Asher who were angry over Joseph’s coat, the sons of Leah and Bilhah had resented Joseph’s special treatment for some time, the cloak had only triggered the jealousy within them. The ten older brothers had always picked on Joseph, but the light badgering had become vicious harassment as his authority over them grew. Day after day, Joseph endured the name calling, the jokes, and the slander. \n\nOne morning, Joseph, adorned in his colorful coat, lead his brothers and the flock out to pasture. A heavy rain the night before had saturated the ground, so Joseph was cautious as he maneuvered his way up and down the hills, forging a trail for the flock behind him. When he came to a particularly steep ravine, Joseph stopped and looked down, trying to decide the best way to keep the sheep from sliding down in the mud. But as he stood focused on the drop in front of him, Naphtali snuck up behind and gave him a push. Caught off guard, Joseph tumbled face first into the slippery mud, while Naphtali and the other brothers burst out laughing. Then, Dan, seeing an opportunity to further humiliate Joseph, drove the sheep down the hill and right over top of Joseph as he lay sprawled out in the mud. The men had a good laugh as they walked past Joseph and continued towards the pasture. Left alone, Joseph stood and went to a pool of water nearby to wash himself as best he could. In a moment of defeat, Joseph put his face in his hands and wept. “Why Lord? Why do they hate me so much?” he said, looking up to the sky. He quickly wiped his tears, trying to keep in mind that Yahweh didn’t hate him, and set out to catch up with the flock. His father had given him a responsibility and he would not let him down. \n\n“Oh no, what happened to your precious cloak?” Asher called out in a mocking tone as Joseph approached. \n\n“You better run back home and tell Daddy how you got your new cloak all dirty,” Gad continued, trying to provoke Joseph. But he remained cool and emotionless, determined to do his job as overseer of the flock. \n\nThe next morning, a vivid dream woke Joseph before dawn. As he lay next to the dying fire, a new sense of hope grew in him. Joseph rose and gathered a handful of wood, adding it to the glowing coals. Not far from he and his brothers, the sheep lay curled up in the grass. As his brothers slept, Joseph warmed himself near the fire, enjoying the peaceful silence around him. \n\n“Move out of the way,” Simeon grumbled, shoving Joseph aside. As the other nine joined Simeon, Joseph was pushed further and further outside their circle. \n\nBitter at their rejection, Joseph plopped down on a stone behind them and said, “I had a dream last night. All of us were in the field cutting the wheat, gathering it into bundles, and tying it together. Suddenly, my bundle of wheat stood up and then your bundles stood around it and bowed down to mine.” For a moment no one spoke. Joseph wasn’t sure if they had even heard him. But he noticed Gad’s face burning red and his jaw clenched. Asher’s brow furrowed. Then all ten of his brother’s began to stare Joseph down like an insect that had pestered them long enough. \n\nSimeon came toward him, fist clenched and ready to strike. Joseph quickly got to his feet, but Reuben blocked Simeon’s path, grabbed his arm and whispered, “You know what Father will do, if you harm him.” Then Reuben, a head taller than Joseph, looked down at his little brother. “Who do you think you are Joseph?” Reuben asked him. “Are you worthy of our respect? How could you reign over us?” \n\n“Hah! Never!” Judah interjected. “What have you achieved, but to be the oldest son of Father’s favorite wife? She was an idol worshipper! At least my mother Leah was a better wife.”\n\nIntimidated by Reuben’s size, Joseph tried to step back, but stumbled over a rock and landed on his behind. The tension in the air was quickly dissolved as the brother’s burst out laughing.\n\n“Look who bowing down to the ground now,” Asher called out. The men laughed even harder as Joseph just hung his head, tears dampening the ground beneath him.\n\nDays later when they had returned home, Joseph and his brothers gathered in the tent to share a meal with their father. Joseph reclined at Jacob’s right hand, leaning into his father like he had since he was a child. “I had another dream,” Joseph said, capturing everyone’s attention. Once again, Gad’s face began to turn red. But with his father next to him, Joseph had the courage to continue. “This time in my dream, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were all bowing down to me.” The room was silent as each brother stopped eating and glared at Joseph. Every brother, except one. Little Benjamin continued devouring his food, completely unaware of the implication of Joseph’s dream. “I think the eleven stars represent all of you,” Joseph explained, oblivious to the hole he was digging for himself. \n\nJacob set his bowl down and looked at his seventeen-year-old son sternly. “This is a very grand dream, Joseph. Be careful how you interpret it.”\n\n“This isn’t the first, Father,” Joseph interjected. “I had a dream not long ago where my brother’s bundles of wheat bowed down to my bundle of wheat.” \n\n“Are you claiming that one day you will reign over the entire house of Israel? Will you have authority even over me and your mother?” he asked with a hint of resentment in his tone. \n\nJoseph looked down, suddenly embarrassed. His father rarely rebuked him, especially in front of his brothers. Although, this didn’t keep the jealousy that had sprouted alongside their hatred from taking over in their hearts. Joseph seemed to be chosen not only by their father, but also by Yahweh to reign over their new nation. This was becoming more and more unbearable as each brother wanted the place for himself.\n\nThen Jacob abruptly excused himself and left the tent, deep in thought over what Joseph had just said.\n\t\n**Can you describe Joseph’s first dream? What do you think it meant?** Joseph dreamed that he and his brothers were in the field gathering wheat into bundles. Then his bundle stood up and his brother’s bundles gathered around it and bowed down to it. The dream meant that one day Joseph would rule over them.  \n\n**Can you describe Joseph’s second dream?** Who do you think the sun, moon, and stars represented? Joseph dreamed that the sun, moon, and eleven stars bowed down to him. The sun probably represented his father, Jacob. The moon represented his stepmother, Leah and the eleven stars were his brothers. This was more significant because even his father, the namesake of their nation bowed down to Joseph.\n\n**Why did Joseph’s brothers hate him so much?** Joseph’s brothers wanted what Joseph had. They wanted to be the chosen son, to have the attention and place of honor next to their father. Their hatred was mixed with jealousy, which was a dangerous combination. A similar circumstance had happened when Cain killed his brother Abel. Jealousy mixed with hatred can cause us to take control and act out in sin.\n\t\n**Day 3 - Genesis 37:12-24**\n\nMonths had gone by since Joseph had shared his dreams and yet nothing had changed. The relationship with his brothers had deteriorated even more. His father had finally sent them out to pasture the flocks and away from Joseph in order to gain a little peace in their home. \n\n“Joseph,” Jacob called. “Your brothers have been away for quite some time now. They went up to Shechem and considering the destruction they left behind there years ago, I need you to go check on them.”\n\nJoseph’s heart began to pound. What if they were causing trouble, he thought? He would never be able to stop them. They certainly wouldn’t listen to him. \n\n“Go to Shechem and see if the flock is healthy and your brothers are well. Then return with news of what you have seen,” Jacob explained when he saw the nervous look on Joseph’s face.\n\nRelieved that his only task was to observe, he said quickly, “Yes, Father. I will go.”\n\nWhen Joseph had packed his supplies, he set off on the long journey north to Shechem. He stopped at his mother Rachel’s tomb outside Bethlehem and then set off again eventually reaching Shechem after two days. As he wandered the hills surrounding the city, he looked down at the abandoned buildings below. He was a young boy at the time, but he could remember Shechem once being a bustling place of commerce. It was hard to believe that the violent revenge his brothers carried out resulted in the destruction that lay below him. \n\nAfter climbing the highest point there was still no sign of his brothers. Finally, he descended and made a small camp along a stream in the valley closest the city. \n\n“Hello there,” a man called out as he approached Joseph’s fire. “I saw you wandering in the fields around Shechem today. What are you looking for?”\n\n“Please, sit next to me at my fire.” Joseph offered the stranger. “I have been searching for my brothers. They are shepherding my father’s flocks and I was sent to check on them.”\n\n“Oh…I saw your colorful coat. Who is your father?” the man asked, recognizing Joseph as someone important. \n\n“I come from the house of Israel.”\n\nThe man stood and immediately backed away from Joseph. \n\n“I am looking for my brothers. There are ten of them. Have you seen them?”\n\nThe man nodded, clearly frightened of Joseph. “Yes, I have seen the sons of Israel,” his voice a little shaky. “They were here in Shechem, but they left a while ago. I heard them say they were going to Dothan.”\n\nAt that, the man took off towards Shechem. Joseph remained by his fire, remembering the fear people living around the city had towards his family. The next morning, Joseph packed up and made the short journey north to Dothan. \n\nGad caught sight of Joseph first. “Look!” he shouted at his brothers. “It’s the dreamer!”\t\n\nThe brothers looked up and caught sight of Joseph in his colorful coat on the hill to the south of them. “He has probably come to check on us. He will give Father another bad report, saying that we weren’t in Shechem and that he found us in Dothan,” Naphtali said. \n\n“I say we kill him!” Simeon said. Without hesitation, Levi, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher agreed. \n\n“Look at all these empty pits around here. We can kill him and then throw him into one. They are so deep, no one will find him. We can just say a fierce animal devoured him. No one will suspect a thing,” Levi offered.\n\n“I guess his dreams will mean nothing then!” Judah smirked. \n\nAs the brother’s continued to plot Joseph’s death, Reuben stepped in and overheard their plans. “Wait, it’s not a good idea to kill him. Just throw him in the pit without hurting him.” he said, seeing a way the situation could play out for his own advantage. As Jacob’s oldest son, Reuben had traditionally held the birthright, but had lost it when he dishonored his father by taking Bilhah, who belonged to Jacob. Now he saw a chance to regain that honor. Once his brother’s threw Joseph in the pit, Reuben planned to rescue him and return him to his father.\n\nHis brothers approved of the plan, respecting their older brother’s advice. As Joseph came closer, the colorful cloak flowing behind him only aggravated their hatred and jealousy. But when he approached them, the brother’s put on a show of happiness at his arrival.\n\n“Peace be with you, Brother!” Levi called out as he walked towards Joseph, his arms outstretched. “It’s so good to have you here,” he said as tried to embrace Joseph. But then Levi’s embrace became tighter and tighter. Suddenly, Simeon came from behind and the two of them forced Joseph to the ground. Joseph screamed and fought back, but they quickly overpowered him. Gad and Dan ripped the coat from his shoulders and threw it in the dirt. Then they carried Joseph to the empty pit and threw him in. \n\nReuben watched as Joseph hit the bottom with a heavy thud. The pit was once a well but had dried up. It was so deep, he wondered if Joseph had even survived the fall. Then, he saw a bit of movement and a whimper. Relieved, he left Joseph behind and wandered away in search of a rope while his brothers callously went back to their camp to prepare a meal.\n\n**Why did Jacob send Joseph to Shechem?** Jacob sent Joseph to check on his brothers who were shepherding the flocks near Shechem.\n\n**When the brothers saw Jacob coming, what did they want to do to him?** Joseph’s brothers wanted to kill him and then throw him in the pit.\n\n**Why did Reuben tell his brothers not to kill Joseph?** Reuben wanted to rescue Joseph later and return him to his father. He was hoping to gain favor from his father for his actions.\n\n**Why did Joseph’s brothers want him to die?** Joseph’s brothers were jealous of his position in the family and the dreams he had been given. This means they desired what he had and wanted it for themselves. They thought they might have a chance at attaining it if they killed him. \n\n**Day 4 - Genesis 37:25-36**\n\nJudah could hear Joseph’s wails and it was starting to get to him. He certainly hated the way his father favored Joseph, but did he really deserve to be left for dead, he wondered? Guilt began take its grip on him while he squirmed amongst Joseph’s cries for mercy. Judah got up and paced the camp, wondering how he could convince his cruel brothers not to leave Joseph for dead. Not too far away, Judah spotted a caravan headed toward them on the road. An idea came to him. He quickly went back to where his brothers were eating the meal and said, “Look, Joseph is our brother, and we can’t have his blood on our hands. Plus, there is no profit for us in his death. A caravan of Ishmaelites is headed this way with all sorts of merchandise. It looks like they are headed to Egypt. We can sell him to them,” Judah explained. \n\nHis brothers agreed, despite Simeon and Levi’s objections. So, Judah went out to meet the caravan and negotiated the life of his brother for twenty pieces of silver. Using some rope from the caravan, they quickly lifted Joseph out of the pit. Wounded from the fall and completely defeated, Joseph no longer tried to get away. Nevertheless, the Ishmaelites secured his hands with a rope, put him with the other slaves and hauled him away. The relief Judah had expected to feel never came. All he could see was the pain in his brother’s eyes as they gave him over to the Ishmaelites. It wasn’t a physical pain, but pain from the knowledge of his brother’s betrayal. It would be forever etched in Judah’s memory.\n\nThey returned to camp in search of Joseph’s cloak so they could cover their tracks. As Dan worked on slaughtering a goat, Reuben returned. His clothes were torn, and he looked distraught.\n\n“Where have you been?” Simeon asked. \n\n“I went looking for a rope so I could rescue Joseph out of the pit,” Reuben said. “He is gone! Where did he go?”\n\n“While you were away, we sold him to some Ishmaelite traders. He is on his way to Egypt,” Judah explained. \n\nReuben began to weep tear his clothes even more. “Where will I go? What will I do?” he wailed. “I am responsible for him. What will father say?”\n\n“We have a plan, Reuben. No need to worry,” Levi said, making sure he wasn’t going to make things difficult. With very few other options, Reuben yielded to their plans.\n\nWhen they arrived in Hebron, they presented Joseph’s colorful coat to their father. It was almost unrecognizable beneath the dirt and dried goat’s blood.\n\n“We found this cloak in the field while we were with the sheep,” Reuben said to Jacob, looking at the floor trying to hide his deception. “Tell us, Father, does it belong to Joseph?”\n\n“Yes, this cloak belongs to my son,” he said hesitantly as he turned it over in his hands. “Where is he? Why did he not return with you?”\n\n“He never reached us, Father,” Simeon lied. “We only found his cloak.”\n\nTears ran down Jacob’s cheeks. “A wild animal must have devoured him on his way to find you. He must have been torn to pieces. Look at his precious cloak. He could never have survived.”\n\nDistraught over what he thought was the death of his most precious son, Jacob tore his clothes and wailed. His mourning went on for days as his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he could not be consoled. \n\t\n\n**Who tried to keep Joseph alive after his brothers threw him in the pit?** Judah tried to save Joseph from death by selling him to the Ishmaelite traders.\n\n**How did Joseph’s brothers deceive their father into thinking Joseph was killed by a wild animal?** Joseph’s brothers dipped his colorful cloak in goat’s blood and gave it to their father.\n\n**If God had chosen Joseph for a special purpose, why did God allow his brothers to treat him so terribly?**  When we put our faith in Jesus, we experience the joy of belonging to God, but sometimes those chosen by God are hated by the world. However, suffering for the sake of Jesus is never permanent and God always uses it for a greater purpose. \t\n\n**Joseph was hated by his own brothers because the Lord had chosen him for a special purpose. Jesus says that those who follow him will be hated, but, like Joseph, the Lord will use them for a special purpose.**\n\n\n\n",

                        "value": "**A narrative for the young based on the lesson’s text**\n\n“Ready…ATTACK!” Eliezer called out as six men stepped forward from their columns wielding knives, striking the invisible enemy facing them. From behind came six spears, their sharp bronze tips glimmering in the sunlight, as they flew overhead. They hit the ground with precision, one after the other, ahead of the front line.  Eliezer motioned the men with spears to retrieve their weapons and step aside so the next line of six could step forward to practice their skills with the battle axe. Then he looked over his shoulder at Abram, eager to see if he approved of their progress. For months, Eliezer had personally trained over three hundred of Abram’s men for battle. Rumors of a rebellion in the south against King Chedorlaomer had reached them in Mamre. Abram had expected a war was coming months ago and instructed Eliezer, his servant, to prepare his men for battle. Although Abram had no intention of joining the war, he wanted the men prepared to defend their home from invaders.  Not long after, news arrived that King Chedorlaomer and his three allies had come down from the north to squash the rebel kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zevoiim, and Zoar.  Even now, clouds of thick black smoke rose into the sky in the direction of the Jordan Valley. \n\nAbram nodded to Eliezer, pleased with the improvements the men were making. He took a deep breath and as the smoke entered his lungs, his thoughts turned to Lot. He couldn’t help but worry about his young nephew and family dwelling in Sodom, so close to the battle. Abram left Eliezer to continue the training. As he turned to head back towards the tents, he caught sight of someone heading towards them in the distance. Abram quickened his pace, reaching the edge of the camp as the man approached. “Abram the Hebrew! Abram, the foreigner! I am looking for Abram the Hebrew,” the man called out. \n“Yes, I am he,” Abram replied as he calmly approached the man.\n\n“I have urgent news. Your kinsmen Lot has been captured!” the stranger blurted out while trying to catch his breath.\n\n“How do you know this? What happened?” Abram asked. \n\n“Chedorlaomer won the battle, so they plundered the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. They took everything, including Lot, his family, and all his possessions. They captured me as well, but I escaped. Lot had spoken often of you, so I came here looking for help.”\n\n“Come,” Abram motioned to the man to sit by the fire while Sarai and his servant Hagar brought the men drinks. Hearing the commotion, Mamre, the Amorite, came from his tent and joined them as well. Abram sat quietly, assessing the situation as Mamre questioned the man further. “How could Chedorlaomer win against all five of those kings? Sodom and Gomorrah were fighting on their own land,” Mamre asked. \n\n“Chedorlaomer and his allies had a new kind of bow giving them the ability to scale the walls of the cities. After they conquered the cities, they lured the armies of the rebellion into the Valley of Siddim to fight, creating a trap. The Kings of Sodom and Gomorrah met them in the valley, but they were defeated, so they turned and fled. However, in their attempt to get away, they fell into bitumen pits. It was horrible, thousands died!” The stranger broke down, sobbing, and clenching his fists until they were white.\n\nMamre looked to Abram who stood for a long while in silence. He spoke quiet, but stern, “You people of the southern cities, you spend your time seeking pleasure and comfort. You were not prepared for this war. It’s no wonder you have been defeated.” Turning to Mamre he said, “We are going to war. If you are willing to join, prepare your men and call your brothers, I must go rescue my nephew.”\n\nMamre agreed and left to prepare his men and Abram’s other allies, while Abram headed towards the alter under the oak tree. He kneeled and said, “Yahweh, I ask for your blessing in this endeavor to rescue my kinsmen. Give me and my men the courage to fight this great army for his freedom.”\n\nBefore the sun had set, all 318 of Abram’s men stood ready and armed. Scouts were sent ahead to track King Chedorlaomer and his men, while the army followed Abram and his allies north. They traveled through the night and into the next day with only a few hours of rest. Desperate to catch up to Lot’s captors before they reached the protection of their home, Abram pushed his men to the brink of exhaustion. By the afternoon of the third day, the scouts returned with news that Chedorlaomer’s men were over the next hill. Abram separated the men into smaller attack parties as they waited for nightfall. Each party had its own advantage. Mamre and his brothers were large ferocious nomads with tremendous strength. Eliezer, originating from Damascus, knew the land like the back of his hand and his warriors were trained in Egyptian battle tactics. As powerful as the armies of Chedorlaomer were, catching them off guard in the middle of the night gave the allied forces the element of surprise.  As Abram’s army moved quickly through their enemy’s camp Abram searched desperately for his nephew.  Sumerians were known to get rid of their male prisoners as soon as possible. They would be sold off as slaves or sacrificed to their gods. \n\n“Lot! Lot!” Abram shouted out over the sound of clashing metal as men swung their clubs and sliced one another with their daggers. After circling most of the camp, Abram finally found the prisoners tied to one another. He looked a one dirty face after another, most of them weak and unable to stand. Eventually a familiar face stood out. One of Lot’s daughters called to him, “Uncle Abram, he’s here but they have beaten him within an inch of his life.”\n\nAbram quickly cut her ropes and they began setting the prisoners free as they continued their search for Lot. Then, slumped behind a tree was his nephew. “Lot, wake up!” Abram said as he patted his cheek. Lot tried to open his eyes and mumbled the word water. Abram lifted his skin of water to Lot’s mouth and untied his hands. As he hovered over his nephew, breathing a sigh of relief, Abram looked around and realized for the first time that his army had the upper hand. They might actually win this battle and escape with their lives. Then his thoughts flashed back to the promises Yahweh had made. Of course, Yahweh would protect him, why had even doubted that. “Can you stand?” Abram asked Lot, offering his hand. “I need you to look after your family while I help my men.” Lot stood and started to gather his family and friends who were with them while Abram mounted his horse. “We’ll come back for you,” he called out as he rode off in pursuit of the enemy trying to flee with prisoners.\n\nAbram and his men pursued Chedorlaomer and his men further north until they defeated them near Damascus. They gathered the stolen possessions and the remaining prisoners and returned south. The trip home was slow. Many of the former captives were still recovering from their ill treatment as well as loads of stolen possessions had to be hauled over rough terrain. \nAlthough Abram was eager to return home, he almost enjoyed the crawling journey. Astride his horse, he reflected on all that Yahweh had done. Peace and joy seemed to flow from him with each step of his horse. The satisfaction in knowing that the Lord had given him the courage he needed to set Lot free brought a new hope of what was to come. When they reached the Valley of Shaveh outside the city of Salem, Abram was overjoyed to see Melchizedek the king of Salem with the King of Sodom gathered together to meet him on his journey home. Priest and king of Salem, Melchizedek was a worshiper of Yahweh, the God most High. Abram had great respect and admiration for the King of Salem and he was honored that he would come out to meet with him. \n\nAbram dismounted and entered the cool shade of the tent. Reclining on a rug before him was Melchizedek. Abram bowed his head and then kneeled down in honor of the king-priest. As he took his seat the king of Sodom also entered, bowing low before the two men before taking his place next to Abram.\n\nAfter everyone was seated Melchizedek spoke, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your hand!” for such a small elderly man, he spoke with great power and presence. he paused a moment. “Bring the bread and wine,” Melchizedek called to the servant. The three men ate and drank together. \n\n“God Most High has certainly favored you, Abram,” Melchizedek continued. “Tell me again the story of how you came to know him. \n\n“Yahweh called me out of Ur and told me to come to this land. I wasn’t always a worshipper of the Lord. My father sacrificed to the pagan gods, but we left that behind when we left Haran. The Lord promised me land here and I believe him,” he explained.\nMelchizedek raised his eyebrows. “A bold claim,” he replied, looking intently at Abram. Uninterested in the ways of their god, the king of Sodom, interrupted, impatient to lay claim to what rightfully belonged to him. \n\n“Commander of armies, favored of the gods, Abram, our savior, we are extremely grateful for all you have done,” the king flattered. “Please, take the goods you collected for yourself but give me the people.”\n\n“I have made an oath to Yahweh, God Most High, that I would not take a sandal strap or a thread or anything that is yours. So, you cannot claim that it was you who made me rich. I will take nothing but what my men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Mamre and his brothers take their share.”\n\n“Oh…how generous of you!” the king of Sodom said, genuinely shocked by Abram’s response, but a little disappointed he nothing with which to leverage Abram later on. \n\nAbram turned to Melchizedek, “To you I leave a tenth of all that I acquired at the hand of the Lord. To Him be the glory!”\n\n“And praise be to God Most High,” the high priest replied.\n\nAfter the brief meeting, Abram continued south with Lot and his family to Sodom. Abram spent much of the journey trying to persuade to Lot to leave Sodom. He desperately wanted to protect his nephew and family, but Lot had his heart set on staying in the city. So, Abram returned to his home, greeted Sarai, hoping to find her with a growing belly. He tried to cover his disappointment with his excitement at seeing her, for her shame of barrenness was written all over her face. The joy of his victory was momentarily forgotten as he wondered who would inherit all of these blessings from the Lord.\n\nThat night as Sarai lay sleeping, Abram tossed and turned, anxious over what the future held. Would Chedorlaomer return with a larger army in retaliation? Would he be able to defend his house? Suddenly, his surroundings changed, and he heard the voice of Yahweh. “Fear not, Abram, I am your shield, I will continue to defend you; your reward shall be very great.” But Abram said, “Oh Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue on childless? Currently, the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus. He is my head servant but not my offspring. How will you fulfill your promise?” he said, pouring out his burdens.\n\nGod’s word came to him saying, “Eliezer will not be your heir. Your very own son will be your heir. Come with me,” Yahweh said as he led Abram outside the tent. Abram stood slowly, careful not to wake his wife. Stepping into the cool air, he noticed how clear and bright the night sky was. “Look toward heaven and number the stars, if you are able to number them,” the Lord instructed him. “So shall your offspring be.” Abram looked up and started to count 1…2…3…4, but before long he lost track as he caught sight of new stars he had previously missed. He looked at Yahweh, who nodded. How could he do anything but trust the words of Yahweh. If he said it, it would be done.\n\n“Abram, I am the Lord who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess,” as he stretched his arm out before him. \n\n“O Lord God, how am I to know that I shall actually possess it? Please, strengthen my faith, Lord and give me a sign.”\n\n“Bring a heifer, three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon,” the Lord instructed.\n\nAbram had enough wisdom to recognize that these animals were to be used in a covenant ceremony. So, Abram and his servants spent the next day gathering each that the Lord had instructed. He laid them in out in the field near the altar, cutting each in half, except the birds. Then Abram waited. He waited all afternoon near the animals he had prepared for the covenant ceremony, periodically chasing away the birds of prey lingering near the carcasses. As he watched the animals, he considered what he had asked of Yahweh. He wanted assurance of the promises he had made, and Yahweh had responded with a covenant. What had he gotten himself into, he asked? What would be required of him? If he made a covenant with the Lord, he would be responsible to keep his part of the agreement, or face death. His doubt wasn’t in Yahweh, it was only in himself. Every blessing, every victory he had ever had, had come from the Lord. He had absolutely nothing to offer him. Despite, the feeling of complete inadequacy, Abram resolutely waited on the Lord, hoping his part of the agreement would not be too much. \nThe sun began to sink below the hills as Abram rested his head in the soft grass falling into a deep sleep. In his sleep, a great darkness fell upon him and he saw a multitude of people, and the Lord spoke to Abram saying, “Know this: your descendants will live as outsiders in a land not their own; they’ll be enslaved and beaten down for 400 years. But I will punish the nation they serve, and your offspring will march out of there loaded with plunder. But not you; you’ll have a long and full life and die a good and peaceful death. Not until the fourth generation will your descendants return here, for the sin of the Amorites is not yet complete.”\n\nThe sun had fully descended, and the stars shown above when Abram finally began to wake. Feeling disoriented, Abram slowly opened his eyes, trying to remember where he was. A suspended torch caught his attention and next to it a pot with smoke billowing from within. Eyes glued to this spectacular sight in front of him, he pushed himself to a sitting position, attempting to understand what was happening. The torch and the pot were passing between the pieces of the separated carcasses. Then the voice of the Lord spoke again, “To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates, and the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites and the Jebusites.” When the torch and pot had passed through each animal, they disappeared, and the voice was gone. Abram stood, confused that Yahweh had not asked him to walk between the animals, binding himself in the agreement as well. Did Yahweh commit on his behalf as well? How was it that the Lord had promised him so much and yet had not asked him to do or keep any requirement of the covenant? Who was this Lord he served?\n\n**Abraham was counted a righteous man in God’s eyes because he simply believed what the Lord promised him and trusted in his mercy and grace. When we trust in the Lord’s mercy and grace in the same way, we can be called righteous as well.**\n\n\n\t",

Do you know what they used with the sword for protection? They used a shield. The shield kept the warrior from getting hurt.  \n\nOne day, Abram received news that his nephew, Lot, had been captured by a very large army of warriors. So, Abram went on a rescue mission to save him. Abram chased down the army with a very small group of men. Although it seemed they could never win a battle against such a great army, the Lord was with Abram and he was victorious! Lot was free! \n\nWhen Abram went home that night he could not sleep. He was very scared. What if the great army came back to attack, he thought to himself. Then the Lord spoke to him and said, “Abram, have no fear. I am your shield. I will protect you.” \n\n“How do I know you will keep your promise,” Abram asked. “I still don’t have a child. Will this land you gave me, actually be mine? How do I know you will keep your promise?”\n\nSo, the Lord made an official agreement with Abram, called a covenant. When it was dark, God came as a flaming torch and a smoking pot to show Abram that he would always keep his promises. The Lord would never fail. Abram believed with all of his heart that what God said would come to pass. So, God forgave Abram’s sins and he received eternal life because he trusted him.\n\n**When we trust the Lord like Abram did, he will forgive our sins and give us everlasting life as well.**\n"

                        "value": "*Lesson Principle:*   \nFaith is putting your trust in a God who binds himself to his promises\n\n----------\n\n**Genesis 14:1-16 – Faith refines character.**\n\nThis chapter gives us historical context and helps us understand how God worked out his plan of redemption in the world. In chapter 14 we read about the first recorded war in the Bible. Although the geographical area may seem like a speck on the map to us, it would have been a big deal to those who were caught in the middle of this international conflict. It is interesting that the four kingdoms from the former region of Babel were the cause of this war, and Moses called these four kingdoms “the enemy”. Most likely these four kings from the east were the ones controlling the trade routes and were demanding a tax from the other kingdoms to maintain peace. When the five kingdoms in the Jordan valley decided to rebel against their oppressors, it caused a response that they were unprepared for. Abram’s part in this story is completely passive until he receives word of Lot’s capture. By engaging in the fight against the Mesopotamian kings, led by Chedorlaomer, Abram risked losing his possessions, his life, his family and, regardless of the outcome, would have definitely gained some powerful enemies. However, his love for Lot, and his trust in God’s promises allowed him to respond with courage. It is here that we also read Abram being called a “Hebrew” for the first time.  The name “Hebrew” coupled with Abram’s character, distinguishes him from the other kings and people groups living around him in Canaan.   \n\n1. What does this story tell us about the world in which Abram lived?\n2. What observations can be made about Lot’s captivity?\n3. How does this chapter reveal to us Abram’s character development?\n\n\n**Genesis 14:17-24 – True faith gives credit where credit is due.**\n\nReturning home victorious, Abram meets two kings who offered him two very different gifts. Abram’s response to the kings offers is telling of his interpretation of the victory in battle. Although the King of Sodom and the King of Salem were allies, what they stood for and represented was very different. Melchizedek, whose name means, “King of Righteousness” was the king of ancient Jerusalem. Because very little is known about this priestly king the bible uses him as a representation of Messiah in Psalm 110 and Hebrews 7. Abram was living in close proximity to the kingdom of Salem, and therefore it is likely that these two knew each other prior to this event. Melchizedek may have been Abram’s king to whom he was paying tribute upon his return from battle. Regardless of their relationship it is evident they knew one another as being co-worshippers of the one true God. Although scholars have made connections between Melchizedek’s gift of bread and wine and Jesus, the gift was likely a common ceremonial act between kingdoms in those days. The name of God used in this passage is El-Elyon, the possessor of heaven and earth. This title reveals God’s sovereignty over all things, declaring that both Melchizedek and Abram were intentional about giving God all the glory. \n\n1. What is the central point of Melchizedek’s prayer?\n2. What concern did Abram have that led him to reject the gift from the King of Sodom?\n3. What principle(s) in this passage can you apply to your own life?\n\n\n**Genesis 15 – God binds himself to his promises**\n\nAbram had much to be concerned about. He had bested a major Mesopotamian kingdom who would most likely seek revenge. The rest of the land where he was living was riddled with warring tribes. He had no living heir and he and his wife were not getting any younger. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt are natural responses to his situation. God speaks to Abram to reassure him of the promises he has made him. Abram’s response in the middle of this chapter is perhaps the most important verse in the entire Bible. Abram chooses to believe that what God promises was a greater reality than his dire circumstances. In this chapter, the doctrine of justification by faith is set forth for the first time. It is important to here to see that Abram trusted in God and hoped in a promise. This means the promises of God are the content of faith, but the object of faith is God. What follows after Abram’s faith in God is the Abrahamic Covenant. This particular covenant that God made with Abram usually involves two parties walking through the divided animals together, making the promise official and binding the two parties to fulfill their end of the agreement. However, this is not how the story is played out. God alone passes between the parts indicating that Abram had no obligation to fulfill in order to receive the covenant promises. Yahweh binds himself to the promise he made to Abram in passing through the animals as a solemn covenant act. As a symbol of holiness, judgement, and protection, God passes through the sacrificed animals as a smoking oven and flaming torch. \n\n1. What do the “I am” statements in verse 1 and 7 tell us about God?\n2. What are the conditions of the covenant that God bound himself to?\n3. What does this text teach us about God’s view of Abram?\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n**Romans 4:1-9 – The path to righteousness has never changed.**\nDoing something good, moral, or righteous to be accepted by God (or gods) is a common belief in most religions. To earn acceptance, we must do something to prove our worthiness. Romans may be one of the most powerful, and influential letters that the Apostle Paul ever penned. In it he lays out the doctrine of justification by faith apart from works. Although this doctrine is established in Genesis 15, this bedrock truth had been long forgotten in Judaism, having been replaced by a doctrine that taught salvation through works of the Mosaic Law. To defend the truth of justification by faith Paul points to Abraham, the father of faith. Jews have always held up Abraham as the supreme example of righteousness, and Paul wanted the believers in Rome to see the basis for his righteousness was not works, but faith in God.  \n\n1. What is the central point that Paul wants the reader to know in this passage?\n2. What does this passage reveal to us about God’s character?\n3. How does this teaching shape our motive for serving God? \n4. When sharing the Gospel with others, why is this teaching so hard for people to accept?\n\n$$$$$$$",

He has always been, because he has no beginning and no end. Even before the universe began, he was. Sounds a bit lonely, right? But actually, he was and never will be alone. He is one God dwelling in three persons unified in a perfect relationship as Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n\nThe Father had made plans to create a wonderful world for his Son, whose name in Hebrew is “Yeshua”. So, God created the heavens and the earth, but the earth’s a deserted wasteland of deep dark water. God saw the darkness as his Spirit hovered over it. Then, Yeshua, the World and perfect image of his Father said, “Let there be light”. And instantly there was light. He made the light separate from the darkness and called it day and the darkness night. That became the first day, marking the beginning of time.\n\nOn the second day, Yeshua said,“Let there be space between the waters.” He called the space above the water, sky. Then God continued his work on the third day. Yeshua said, “Let dry land appear.”He called the dry land, Earth, and he brought the waters together and called them, Seas. Then he said,“Let the earth grow plants, plants producing seeds, and plants producing fruit. Let there be many kinds of plants.” And it was done, just as he said.\n\nOn the fourth day God made the sun, moon, and start. “These will determine the measurement of time, for making the seasons, the days, and the years.” Then, on the fifth day, he filled the waters with sea creatures and the sky with birds. God blessed the man said, “it is good” because it was exactly what he had in mind to create.\n\nFinally, the sixth day came. “Let there be living creatures on the earth.  Let there be wild animals and farm animals. Let there be animals of all different kinds,” said Yeshua. He looked at everything that had been created and saw that it was good.\nBut he still had one more special creation in mind. He said. “Let us make people to resemble who we are.” So, he created a male and a female and blessed them. “Have many children and take care of this earth. I am putting you in charge over my creation. The plants and the trees and its fruit are for you to eat. Be responsible caretakers,” Yeshua explained to them. Then the sun set, completing the sixth day of God’s work of creation. The seventh day came, and God decided to make it a special day.\n\nHe had finished his work of creation, was pleased with everything he saw on the earth. So, the seventh became different from all the other days because God rested. God look over all of his creation and said, “Yes, it is all very good”.\n\n**God, The Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit created our extraordinary earth and vast universe. Yeshua (Jesus), is the word of God who spoke the words that brought our earth to life. He is God, and therefore our creator and King, because everything created belongs to him.**",

                        "value": "**A narrative for the young based on the lesson’s text**\n\n**Day 1 - Genesis 39:1-6**\n\n“Sold!... to Potiphar for thirty shekels of silver,” the Ishmaelite slave trader announced. Joseph watched as a large man arrayed in Egyptian royal armor came forward to claim his purchase. He looked at Joseph closely, inspecting him like a prized horse. Then with a nod of his head, Potiphar’s servant grabbed the rope that bound Joseph’s hands and neck as they followed the captain through the busy streets along the Nile River until they came to a house almost as big as Pharoah’s palace. Joseph had never seen anything like it. He assumed his master must be of great importance. Perhaps he was a part of Pharoah’s royal guard or army, he thought. \n\nThe center room was built up so high, he could see it from outside the gate. Glittering in the sunlight, the limestone in the walls caught his attention immediately. Joseph felt a tug at the rope around his wrists as the servant entered the gate behind Potiphar. Flowers of almost every color and smell overwhelmed his senses as they made their way through the garden surrounding the house. Eventually he was brought to the slave quarters where the servant pointed to a mat on the dirt floor. Joseph gathered that this would be where he slept. The Egyptian language was still foreign to him, sounding nothing like his own Hebrew language. So, when the servant pointed to the gardens surrounding his master’s house, he assumed he was to begin his work. \n\nJoseph worked hard trimming trees, cultivating the soil, chasing away pests, and growing new plants. The work seemed to be endless in the luscious garden, but Joseph labored on, grateful for the distraction from the pain of what his brothers had done to him. The wound was still fresh, and Joseph hoped that in time Yahweh would heal it, even amid his life as a slave. His hope in Yahweh was all he had left. Benefits that came with being the favorite son of Israel had vanished. The prince was now a slave. However, he refused to give up hope that the blessing from Yahweh was being kept in heaven for him. He believed that no matter how hard his trials became, Yahweh was with him.\n\nPotiphar’s garden became even more beautiful under Joseph’s care and his wife, Jamila, took notice. She frequented the garden more often, strolling through the enchanting chamomile and lotus flowers. Jamila noticed Joseph as well and helped him with his language skills. By the end of his first year in Egypt, Joseph was able to communicate well and had built a reputation for himself as a very reliable hand. \n\n“Potiphar, have you noticed the gardens since you purchased Joseph?” Jamila asked one afternoon as they relaxed in the central room of the house, trying to escape the heat of the sun. “He has done excellent work. The garden has never looked so beautiful. You might want to consider giving him more responsibility. He shows real promise in his abilities, not to mention he is extremely handsome,” Jamila said with a sly smile. \n\n“That Hebrew slave? He has been overseeing the garden? I will have to look,” he said to his wife.\n\nSo consumed with managing the household, Potiphar had been oblivious to the improvements Joseph had made. After listening to Jamila, he began to take notice and she was right. Amazed at the transformation of his garden, Potiphar made plans to give Joseph more authority. Not only did he make him the manager of his gardens, but his fields as well. Through Joseph’s hard work and remarkable abilities, the crops began to flourish. Quickly, Potiphar became as successful in his farming enterprises as he was with his gardens. \n\nOne day he called to Joseph and said, “I will put you in charge of my household. If you can manage my house as well as you have managed my fields and garden, I will elevate you to the position of overseer permanently,” he explained to Joseph.\n\n“Any success that I have seen has only been through the favor of the God of my father, Jacob. He is Yahweh, the God I serve. With his continued blessing, I will be faithful to do all that you have asked of me,” Joseph answered.\n\nWith Joseph’s new responsibilities came new privileges as well. No longer was he to sleep on a mat in the dirt. He had a room in the house with a bed and was given new clothes befitting his position of household manager. However, this didn’t slow Joseph down. Instead, it enabled him to persevere in his circumstances even more. Because of the hope he had in Lord, he was simply focused on the grace that God had so freely given him even amidst hardship. \n\nJoseph worked on purchasing better food for less money, training the servants to cook and clean in a standard of excellence, and finding extra sources of income for his master by selling fruits from the garden. Success had come to Potiphar’s home by Joseph’s hand, and he recognized it. Nevertheless, Joseph made sure that the credit was not given to him but to Yahweh. \n\n“Joseph,” Potiphar called to him one day. “Your management of my household has brought me great success. From now on, you are the official overseer of my home. Everything I have, I will not withhold from you. It is yours to care for and use, except my beautiful wife, of course,” Potiphar said with a chuckle. “You have made my life easier. Commanding Pharoah’s guard and protecting him is my number one priority and you have allowed me to concentrate on that. So, from now on, you will handle everything in my home so the only thing I need to concern myself with here, is what I will eat.”\n\nThe Lord continued to bless Joseph and give him success in all that he did, in this Joseph felt the Lord’s pleasure and it caused his hope to rise. There was only one concern. Potiphar’s wife had taken a liking to Joseph a bit too much. \n\t\n**Who bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites?** A man named Potiphar, the captain of the guard, bought Joseph.\n\n**Why was Joseph successful in everything he did as Potiphar’s servant?** The Lord was with Joseph, and he was the one giving him the gifts and talents he needed to be successful.\n\n**Why did Potiphar put Joseph in charge of his entire household?** Potiphar recognized his success and saw an opportunity to use Joseph to bring blessing to his entire home and free him up from his own responsibility. \n\n\n**Day 2 - Genesis 39:7-20**\n\nWith Joseph’s position of authority came a weight of responsibility. Awake before dawn and working well into the night, Joseph was faithful to serve Potiphar as if he were serving the Lord. With this new authority came privilege as well. Joseph was no longer treated as the dirty Hebrew slave but a man with power and influence. The servants respected him, as well as the merchants and household staff. Jamila had begun to treat him different too. She had always been flirtatious with him, teasing him about his attractive looks. However, her flirtations were becoming more of an attempt to seduce him.  \n\n“Joseph…oh Joseph,” she would call to him. “Come and bring me a drink of water. I am so very thirsty.” \n\nJoseph always did as she asked, but said, “The servants can bring you whatever you need. I have other responsibilities besides fetching water.”\n\n“Oh Joseph, but it’s you I want, not the water. You are always too busy for me. I want to see you. Remember when we spent those afternoons in the garden while I taught you the Egyptian language? Why can’t we spend time together like that again?” Jamila asked, trying to take his hand.\n\nJoseph quickly pulled away and stepped back. “Jamila, you are another man’s wife. He has given everything to me here in this house except one thing. That one thing is you. I could never betray him and sin so greatly against God,” he explained. “Now I must get back to my duties.”\n\nJamila turned away and in a fit of anger, threw her cup, shattering the clay against the wall. She was accustomed to getting what she wanted, including the attractive servants she took an interest in.\n\n“No one rejects me!” she shouted. “I am the beautiful wife of Potiphar, the captain of Pharoah’s guard!” \n\nOne evening, while Potiphar was at Pharaoh’s palace and the servants had gone to their quarters, Joseph heard a thud from the women’s room. “Joseph!” Jamila cried out with a hint of panic in her voice.\n\nWhen Joseph heard this, he ran across the house to see what had happened. Stretched out across a large cushion on the floor was Jamila, moaning in pain. Her leg exposed from beneath her dress, she pointed to her ankle and said, “Oh Joseph, thank goodness you are here. I tripped over my robe and twisted my ankle. Help me, I am in so much pain,” she exclaimed, moaning once again. \n\nJoseph came towards her, concerned he may need to call for a doctor. Looking closely, he said, “It’s not red. Perhaps the pain will go away quickly.”\n\n“No, it’s serious,” Jamila, said desperately. “Touch my foot and see if it’s swollen.” \n\nJoseph hesitated. He certainly didn’t want to give Jamila the wrong idea. Joseph knelt beside her and said, “I can see it isn’t swollen.”\n\nJamila sat up and suddenly took hold of Joseph’s arm and pulled him towards her. “I am in pain, Joseph! Please lay here and comfort me!” she said, desperate that he might try to leave.\n\nJoseph stood up to try and leave, but Jamila clung to the sleeve of his cloak. “I told you I would not sin against The Lord and take another man’s wife,” he said firmly. “Now please let go of me.”\n\nJamila got to her feet and Joseph realized that Jamila wasn’t in pain, and she hadn’t twisted her ankle. It was all a ploy in order to seduce him. He tried to pull away, but she refused to let go. So, Joseph slipped his arm from the sleeve and ran from the room and out of the house, leaving his cloak behind. Before he had exited the gate, he heard her scream for help, and he knew he could never go back there. \n\n“Help! Help me!” Jamila cried as the servants came running into house. “He attacked me! That Hebrew slave attacked me!” The men of the house drew their daggers. “He ran off when I screamed and left his cloak behind. What are you waiting for!? Go after him!”\n\nThe men did as she commanded and found Joseph crouched against the wall outside the gate. He surrendered to them without resistance and the men of the house locked him up in the servant’s quarters. Meanwhile, Jamila kept Joseph’s cloak near her as she anxiously awaited her husband’s return.\n\n“Master, there has been an incident. Your wife has been hurt,” the head of the household guard said to Potiphar as he arrived at the gate.  \n\n“What?! Where’s Jamila?” Potiphar barked.\n\n“I’m here,” Jamila called from the women’s room. \n\n“What happened?” Potiphar asked her as he knelt beside her taking her hand. \n\n“I am humiliated!” she cried, forcing tears. “That Hebrew slave you brought into this house attacked me! How could you leave me alone with such a man?”\n\n“Joseph? Joseph attacked you?” he asked, baffled at the accusation. “Are you sure it was him? He has been my most trusted servant.”\n\n“How could you question me, Potiphar? I am your wife. Are you siding with a dirty Hebrew over me?” Jamila said. “Look here is his cloak, he ran off and left it behind when I screamed for help.”\n\nAnger swelled in Potiphar. “You are right, Jamila,” he said between gritted teeth. “He is my servant, and he cannot treat you this way!”\n\nGiven no opportunity to defend himself, Potiphar took Joseph that very night to the prison of Pharaoh. “Captain,” the prison keeper said a bit startled, “What brings you here so late at night?”\n\n“I am here to lock up a slave of mine who attacked my wife,” Potiphar explained, handing Joseph over to the keeper. \n\n“Isn’t he the Hebrew who has been the overseer of your house? You said he had been an excellent servant to you.”\n\n“Well, he took advantage of the privileges I gave him. He should have never been near my wife. Now take him away and lock him up.” Without another word, Potiphar turned and left. \n\t\n**What did Potiphar do when his wife accused Joseph of attacking her?** Potiphar put Joseph in prison.\n\n**Potiphar’s wife tempted Joseph to sin. Why did he refuse to do what she wanted?** Joseph’s greatest concern was to honor the Lord. He knew if he gave in to temptation, he would sin against the Lord.\n\n**How can we follow Joseph’s example when we are faced with temptation?** Joseph said no over and over again. Eventually, the only thing left to do was to run away. Sometimes the temptation to sin can be so great that we must literally run from it, like Joseph.\n\n**Day 3 - Genesis 39:21-40:8**\n\nAs the keeper led Joseph through the prison, the stench of human excrement was overwhelming. Light from the keeper’s torch scattered the rats into the shadows while he opened the door to Joseph’s cell. Joseph entered the dark empty room and sank down against the back wall as the door slammed behind him. Sleep refused to come that night…if it was night. Joseph wasn’t sure what time of day it was. Without a window, he had no access to daylight. At some point a small piece of stale bread and a cup of water was slid under the door, but before he could reach it, the rats had already grabbed it and run off. \n\nJoseph shuddered. “Why, oh Lord, why am I here?” he called out in desperation. “You have promised me a great inheritance, yet here I am locked in a prison. Why are you allowing this to happen to me?” When no answer came, Joseph began to recount everything his father and grandfather had taught him about Yahweh and his promises. Did I misunderstand something, he asked himself? However, the more he remembered the more he was certain that the promise was for him, and that Yahweh would be faithful to it. “I must be patient, for I know you are with me, Lord, as you were with my father.” \n\nThe next day, the prison keeper opened Joseph’s cell door and said, “Come with me. We are moving you with the others.”\n\nJoseph followed obediently eventually entering a larger room but equally dark. From the fading light of the keeper’s torch, Joseph could make out a handful of men scattered throughout the cell. Uncertain of what these men were capable of, Joseph kept to himself against the wall. The next morning a tiny sliver of light had forced its way through a crack in the wall giving the men the opportunity to inspect him.\n\n“Why are you locked up in here?” one of them asked. Joseph was speechless when he caught sight of the man. Unlike every man he had seen since arriving in Egypt, this man’s face was unshaven, his hair long, and dark. It was like staring into the face of one of his brothers. Suddenly, a wave of homesickness washed over him. What was his father doing right now while he sat in this dungeon, he wondered? \n\n“Hello? Can you hear me?” his fellow prisoner asked again. \n\nJoseph snapped out of his daydream and said, “I was accused of a crime I didn’t commit.”\n\n“Hah! Aren’t we all?” he said sarcastically. “Which royal house were you serving at?”\n\n“Royal house? How did you know I served royalty?” Joseph asked surprised.\n\n“Don’t you know this is Pharoah’s prison. It’s only for those who serve royalty.” For a reason he couldn’t explain, Joseph was even more hopeful at this news. He decided to make the best of his situation and got to work. Joseph began by cleaning up the filth in the men’s cell. Then he called for the prison keeper and offered to clean the other cells as well. When the keeper saw the improvement, he was pleased and so he put Joseph in charge of disposing the rats. Despite the filthy work, Joseph enjoyed serving and he felt the Lord’s presence in it. He had brought him success and the prison environment began to change drastically. So, the keeper continued to give Joseph more and more responsibility until he had practically become the keeper himself. Once again, he was put in a place of authority overseeing the care of every prisoner. \n\nOne day, Potiphar, the captain of Pharoah’s guard, arrived with two men from the palace and said to the keeper, “These men are to remain in custody, and I want Joseph to personally attend to them.”\n\n“Yes, Captain,” the keeper said.\n\nKnowing that these men came directly from the palace, Joseph put all his effort into making sure the two prisoners were well taken care of.\n\n“Who did you serve in the palace?” Joseph asked the men one day when he brought them their food.\n\n“I had a very honorable position. I served Pharaoh himself as his cupbearer. I tasted his wine to ensure no one had poisoned it. Then I served it to him and his royal court. I am one of his most trusted servants…well…I was, until someone tried to poison him,” the cupbearer explained, looking deeply grieved.\n\nBefore he could continue, the second prisoner spoke up and said, “My position was just as honorable. I was Pharaoh’s baker, the one who made all his food and safeguarded everything he ate. I don’t deserve to be in this prison! I had nothing to do with what happened to Pharaoh! It was your fault!” he shouted angrily, pointing at the cupbearer.\n\n“I would never do anything to hurt Pharaoh. It is my responsibility to protect him!” he said, defending himself.\n\nJoseph left the food with the men and went back to the kitchen, curious as to who was truly guilty. He assumed Potiphar and his men were investigating it at that very moment and he would find out soon enough. But time passed, and the two prisoners began to look like every other captive. Their beards grew and their hair became long and scruffy.\n\nOne morning when Joseph came to check on the men, he noticed they looked troubled. “What’s bothering you? Why do you look so downcast?” he asked.\n\n“We each had a dream last night,” the baker said. “I know it means something, but there is no one here to interpret it.”\n\n“The gods have spoken, but we will not know what they have said unless someone can explain what these dreams mean,” the cupbearer explained, with a voice of desperation. \n\n“Don’t interpretations belong to the One God?” Joseph asked. “I have been able to interpret dreams in the past because he has given me the ability. Please, share them with me and God will tell me its meaning.”\n\n**Who did Joseph meet in the prison?** Joseph met two men who served Pharaoh in the palace. One was the cupbearer and the other was the baker. They were accused of a crime by Pharaoh and put in prison.\n\n**Why does 1 Peter 1:6-7 say that trials are necessary?** With 1 Peter 1:6-7 in mind, why do you think God allowed Joseph to be put in prison? Peter says that trials are necessary because our faith must be tested. When our faith is tested, it proves that it is genuine and not fake. When gold is put in a furnace all the impurities are burned off and what remains is pure and beautiful. \nPure and beautiful faith brings praise and glory to our Lord Jesus Christ. One reason God allowed Joseph to be put in prison was to test and purify his faith. He remained faithful to the Lord through his trials revealing it to be pure. \n\n**How was Joseph able to remain hopeful during his imprisonment for a crime he did not commit?** Joseph’s hope was not in his circumstances. He believed that the inheritance the Lord had promised him would be revealed at the right time. This is what he hoped for. \n\n**Have you ever been in a trial where it was hard to trust God in the middle of it? **\n\n** Day 4 - Genesis 40:9-23**\n\nThe men looked shocked. “You, the caretaker of the prison, have the ability to interpret dreams?” the cupbearer asked. “But if you have this extraordinary ability, why are you here in prison. Dream interpreters are honored here in Egypt.”\n\n“But I told you, interpretations belong to God alone,” Joseph answered. “I deserve no honor for giving an interpretation, only God.”\n\n“Yes, yes…that’s all very grand, but let’s get on with it,” the baker interrupted. “If you can interpret, then tell him your dream and see if he is telling the truth.”\n\n“Okay, I will begin,” said the cupbearer. “In my dream there was a vine before me, and on the vine, there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes. Then I looked down and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”\n\nJoseph was silent for a moment while the cupbearer looked hopeful. Then he spoke and said, “Okay, here is what it means: the three branches represent three days. In three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your place as his cupbearer. Just as the dream described, you will once again place Pharaoh’s cup in his hand.”\n\nA smile crept onto the cupbearer’s face. “This is great news!” he exclaimed. “Only three days left in this pit, and I am out of here!”\n\nWhen the baker heard the favorable outcome of the cupbearer’s dream, he was less skeptical of Joseph’s ability and said, “Okay now it’s my turn. Here is what I dreamed: there were three cake baskets stacked on my head. In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating the food out of the basket on my head.”\n\nOnce again, Joseph was quiet for a moment, then he said to the baker, “Here is the interpretation: the three baskets represent three days. In three days, Pharaoh will lift up your head- from your body! You will be hung from a tree. Then the birds will come and eat your flesh.”\n\nJoseph looked away, grieved by his fate. “What?!” the baker shouted. “I don’t believe you. You are just a Hebrew slave. You know nothing of dreams!” Then he spit on Joseph and went to the back of his cell, crouched in the corner.\n\nJoseph turned to the cupbearer, “When you are restored to the palace, please remember me. I was stolen out of my homeland, and I was put in this prison because of a false accusation. I am not guilty of any crime. Do me the kindness of mentioning me to Pharaoh. Maybe my God given ability to interpret dreams could be of use, like you said, and Pharaoh will get me out of his pit,” Joseph pleaded, desperate to escape. \n\nThe cupbearer nodded and said, “I will remember you, Joseph. You have been good to us here.”\n\nOn the third day, Potiphar came to the prison and called for the cupbearer and baker to appear before Pharaoh on his birthday. Joseph wasn’t surprised when he received news that Pharoah had ruled the baker guilty and sentenced him to death by hanging. The cupbearer was then declared innocent and restored to his place at Pharaoh’s side. Everything happened exactly as Joseph had interpreted. Yet the cupbearer forgot about Joseph. He never mentioned him to Pharaoh, so Joseph remained in prison.\n\t\n\n**How was Joseph able to help the cupbearer and baker?** Through the power of God he interpreted their dreams.\n\n**What was Joseph’s interpretation of the two dreams?** Joseph said that Pharaoh would lift the cupbearer out of prison and place him back in his position in the palace to serve wine. Joseph said the baker would not return to his position. Pharaoh would lift the baker onto a tree and hang him.\n\n**Joseph’s faith and hope was put to the test once again when the cupbearer forgot about him. According to 1 Peter 1:7, what will be the result of this test?** 1 Peter says that the testing of our faith will “result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.”\n\n**Do you truly desire to see Jesus Christ glorified, honored, and praised when he returns?**  Our desires are often revealed in trials and testing. Joseph’s desire was great because he was willing to suffer greatly in order for God to be honored and glorified.\n\n\n**The Lord promised Joseph blessing. Joseph believed God’s promise, so it was this belief and trust in God’s promise which gave him hope in his trials. As believers, we can have the hope that Joseph had because The Lord has promised us an inheritance which awaits us in heaven.**\n\n\n\n",

                        "value": "***Lesson Principle:***      Trials are used to shape us into the kind of person God desires us to be.\n\n----------\n\n\n**Genesis 39:1-20 – Character is fashioned in trials and tested through temptation.**\n\nChapter 39 picks up the story of Joseph with him living as a slave in Potiphar's house. Joseph was far from home, living in a foreign land, amongst a foreign people. The covenant-keeping God was with this faithful son of Jacob while he was living as an enslaved person in a foreign land. Although Joseph was not where he might have chosen to be, he recognized that God was with him. \n\nOnce again, Joseph is described to be a young man of character, of high morality and loyalty to God. He was also loyal to those whom he was called to serve. In this challenging situation, we also see the faithfulness of God The blessing of God was so strong that even Joseph's idol-worshipping master recognized God's blessing on him. The overflow of God's blessings upon Joseph extended to the entire household.   \n\nOf course, Potiphar was not the only one who took notice of this young, handsome slave. His rise to authority in the household became a dual-edged sword. On one side, he was entrusted with great responsibility and power in his master's house. But on the other side, his blessings drew the wrong kind of admiration and attention from Potiphar’s desperate housewife. Although Joseph kept his integrity intact by refusing her advances, her lies and deception forced Potiphar to take action against him. Because Joseph was a slave, Potiphar could have just had Joseph killed. Because of his leniency, many think Joseph's master thought him to be innocent of the charges.  \n\n1. What does this text teach us about God's blessings? \n2. How is this story of Potiphar's wife similar to other stories in Genesis? How are they different? (See Genesis chapters 12, 20, and 26) \n3. In what situation have your character and fidelity to God been put to the test? 2. How is Laban’s deception similar to Jacob’s deception of Isaac?\n\n**Genesis 39:21-40:8**\n\nOnce again, Joseph is brought very high before being dragged down by the sin of those around him. In anger, Joseph's brothers stripped him of his robe and sold him into slavery. Now Potiphar's wife strips him of his tunic, framing him for a crime he did not commit. In this narrative, as bad as it was for Joseph to be thrown into a pit by his brothers, the Egyptian prison was the ultimate rock-bottom.  \n\nStill, God shows himself faithful despite the dark and gloomy prison that Joseph finds himself in. Through the blessings of God, Joseph rises again to a place of honour and authority. Although it is a far cry from his father's tents or Potiphar's home, Joseph's position among the other prisoners repeats God's favour and good intentions for this young man. Throughout Joseph's life, the repetition of favour, trial, and blessing is an intentional reminder of God's faithfulness, despite his failure, and the necessity of an obedient, faithful response to God in all circumstances. Although Joseph's actions were evidence of his character, it is essential to see that the blessings directly resulted from God being with Joseph.  \n\nHere in the belly of Pharaoh’s prison, the reader is re-introduced to the topic of dreams. The cupbearer and the baker were both servants in Pharaoh’s household, but sent to prison for reasons unknown. Since Joseph was in charge of the prison, he was given a special duty to care for these two inmates. Sometime during their imprisonment, both men had dreams which disturbed them. Egyptians regarded dreams as very significant predictions. Some men were trained in interpreting dreams, and a lot of literature was written on the topic.\n\n1. How often is the phrase \"and the Lord was with him\" repeated in chapter 39, and what is the significance of this? \n2. What is it about Joseph that is constant, and what is ever-changing? \n3. What do you believe God is teaching Joseph? \n\n\n**Genesis 40:9-23– Trials can be a great place to learn new things.**\n\nThese dreams were unique because they were revelations from God. Joseph gives full credit to Yahweh for his ability to interpret dreams. This shows us that Joseph is aware of God's presence and blessings in his life even while he is in the darkest of places. It is unfortunate for the baker that he was sentenced to death. However, what makes the baker's dream so significant in this story is that Joseph could interpret the meaning of it with complete accuracy. In the same way, he interpreted the cupbearer's dream. Since the interpretation of the cupbearer’s dream was favorable, Joseph saw a possible way out of jail. Although the cupbearer promised to remember Joseph when he was restored, he ultimately forgot about him and did not keep his word. I am sure that it was a great disappointment for Joseph to be given such a special gift to interpret dreams, only to be left in prison and forgotten about. Although the chapter ends on a low note, it is clear that God wanted Joseph in that prison with that cupbearer to discover his ability to interpret dreams. This ability will raise him from jail and into the presence of Pharaoh in the next chapter. \n\n1. Why do you think God allowed Joseph to remain in prison for two more years after interpreting the dreams? \n2. What does this chapter teach us about God's sovereignty in trials? \n3. Has God ever used a challenging situation to equip you or teach you something new? \n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n**1 Peter 1:3-7 – suffering prepares the Christian for a greater reality.**\n\nJoseph endured great suffering, loss, rejection, and deception at the hands of wicked people. Yet through it all, God used suffering as a teacher to build his faith and equip him with the skills necessary to become a great ruler.  \n\n The apostle Peter wrote his letter to believers who were discouraged and confused by the persecution they were suffering because of their faith. Peter reminded the suffering saints of their future hope in Christ. He helped them to see that the trials they faced prepared them for the inheritance they would receive in the future, with Christ. The suffering that Christians endure in this lifetime prepares them for the role that God has prepared for them when Christ returns.  The inheritance that is being kept for you also comes with responsibility because are being equipped to be stewards of the inheritance we will receive in glory. Peter contrasts the short time of suffering with the inheritance that was given to us when we received Christ; this inheritance is being kept for us now while we follow Christ, and will be given to us when the fullness of God's plan of redemption is revealed. Reminding us, the suffering saints, of the unfading inheritance that waits for us in eternity and the good purposes of suffering, draws us near to God and gives us hope.\n\n1. How does Peter describe our inheritance in Christ? Why is this important to know? \n2. According to Peter, how do trials prepare us for heaven? \n3. How is God using your trials right now to prepare you for eternity with Him? \n\n$$$$$$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Hope is the feeling you have when you are anxiously waiting for something you have been promised. Because your parents have promised you a special toy on your birthday, you might wake up every day hopeful that you will receive it on that special day.\n\nJoseph was a man full of hope. His brothers had sold him as slave, and he was brought to Egypt where he worked for a man named Potiphar. The Lord was with Joseph. He made him a great servant to Potiphar. So, Potiphar put Joseph in charge of caring for his house. Potiphar was very happy with Joseph’s work until Potiphar’s wife accused Joseph of sin. However, Joseph hadn’t sinned like she said he did. She lied about him. Nevertheless, Potiphar put Joseph in prison for a crime he didn’t commit.\n\nBeing in prison was very difficult for Joseph, but he continued to trust in the Lord. He knew that God was with him. Because of God’s blessing, Joseph was put in charge of the other prisoners. One day, two new prisoners arrived from Pharaoh’s palace. One man was called the cupbearer. He was an important man who served drinks to Pharaoh. The other prisoner was Pharaoh’s baker. A crime had been committed in the palace, so these two men had been sent to prison.\n\nOne morning when Joseph brought the men their breakfast, they seemed upset. So, Joseph said, “Why do you look troubled?”\n\n“We each had a dream last night,” the baker said. “I know it means something, but there is no one here to help us understand it.”\n\nJoseph said to him, “I have been able to understand dreams in the past because God has given me the ability. Please, share them with me and God will tell me its meaning.”\n\n“Okay, I will begin,” said the cupbearer. “In my dream there was a vine before me, and on the vine, there were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes. Then I looked down and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”\n\nJoseph said, “Okay, here is what it means: the three branches represent three days. In three days, Pharaoh will bring you back to the palace as his cupbearer. Just as the dream described, you will once again place Pharaoh’s cup in his hand.”\n\n“This is great news!” he exclaimed. “Only three days left in this pit, and I am out of here!”\n\nThen the baker said, “Okay now it’s my turn. Here is what I dreamed: there were three cake baskets stacked on my head. In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating the food out of the basket on my head.”\n\nJoseph said to the baker, “Here is what it means: the three baskets represent three days. In three days, Pharaoh will hang you from a tree and the birds will come and peck at you.”\n\n“What?!” the baker shouted. “I don’t believe you! \n\nJoseph said to the cupbearer, “When you go back to the palace, please remember me. I am not guilty of any crime. Maybe Pharaoh will get me out of his pit,” \n\nThe cupbearer nodded and said, “I will remember you, Joseph. You have been good to us here.”\n\nOn the third day, Potiphar decided that the baker was to be hung from a tree, but the cupbearer could return to his job at the palace. Everything happened exactly as Joseph had said. Joseph waited and waited but the cupbearer forgot about Joseph. He never mentioned him to Pharaoh, so Joseph remained in prison. Yet Joseph did not lose hope. He knew the Lord had promised to bless him, so he looked forward to the day when he would receive his blessing.\n\n1. **Who put Joseph in prison?** Joseph’s master, Potiphar, put Joseph in prison even though he had not committed a crime.\n2. **Whose dreams did Joseph interpret?** Was Joseph correct? Joseph told the cupbearer and baker what their dreams meant. His meaning was correct. Everything happened just as Joseph said it would.\n\n**The Lord promised Joseph blessing. Joseph believed God’s promise, so it was this belief and trust in God’s promise which gave him hope in his trials. As believers, we can have the hope that Joseph had because The Lord has promised us an inheritance which awaits us in heaven.**"

Maybe you saw a toy you hadn’t played with in a while, so you spent your time playing and were never able to get all the toys picked up?\n\nJacob also got distracted as he continued towards his father Isaac’s house. He stopped near a city called Shechem and stayed for a long time. But then, the people of that city hurt his daughter and so his sons retaliated by hurting them as well. So, God stepped in and said, “What are you doing here Jacob? Pack up and go to my house at Bethel where you dreamed of the angels coming in and out of heaven.”\n\nJacob was no longer distracted. Preparing his family to worship the Lord, he said to them, “Wash your clothes and wash yourselves then bring me your foreign gods. We are getting rid of all these idols who are distracting us from worshipping the Lord!”\n\nJacob took a shovel and dug a big hole under a tree. Then, one by one, his sons and daughters, wives and servants brought their false gods, carved out of wood and threw them in the hole. Jacob covered them with dirt, leaving them far behind as they traveled to Bethel. \n\nAt Bethel, Jacob built an altar to the Lord and worshipped him there. Then God appeared to him and said, “Jacob, you will officially be called Israel now. For I am making you into a nation. Just as I promised your grandfather Abraham and I promised your father Isaac, I promised to give you land to dwell in and many children.”\n\nThen Jacob continued to his father Isaac’s home in Hebron, and along the way, God continued to keep his promise. Rachel bore Jacob another son and named him Benjamin. \n\t\n1. What did Jacob bury in the ground? Jacob buried all the idols among his household which were distracting them from the one true God.\n2. What did God promise Jacob? God promised to bless Jacob with land and children. He also changed his name to Israel.\n\n**Jacob got distracted by the cities around him, but God kept on loving Jacob and reaffirmed his promise to bless him. We must be careful not to let things distract us from our love for God.**"

Perhaps he was avoiding his brother Esau.\nMaybe he’d settled into a nice spot near civilization and decided he had gone far enough. Whatever his reason, the ten-year stay proved to be a crucial mistake for Jacob; and, as horrible as the story of Dinah and the desolation of the city of Shechem is, we must ask why this story is here in the first place.\n\nMoses included this chapter because Israel's greatest threat was the seduction of blending in with the Canaanites. Jacob thought he was in great danger when facing Esau. However, by contrast, he was safer when surrounded by a regiment of angels. Jacob thought living near friendly neighbors was safe but, in reality, he was in great danger. He was endangering his whole family and future generations.\n\nA second reason for the inclusion of this story is to explain why Jacob chose to pass over Levi and Simeon, giving the blessing to Judah instead. The anger of these two brothers towards Shechem, was justified. Perhaps their father's lack of concern for their sister inflamed their rage. It is correct to be angry about sin, but they were angry for the wrong reason; they were not concerned about God's glory but their family honor. Their focus on Shechem's sin made them blind to their own sins of deception, vengeance, murder, and theft. If you think of it, they were doing what their father had modeled to them throughout their lives.\n\n1. Who committed the greater sin in this story?\n2. What does this story have to do with the larger narrative of God's promise to Abraham?\n3. What does this story teach us about the dangers of assimilating with the world?\n\n\n**Genesis 35 – Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you.**\n\nSince returning to Canaan, Jacob had yet to fulfill the vow he’d made to God in chapter twenty-eight. One reason for this was the continuing presence of idols that Rachel and others had brought from Haran. Jacob's family's persistence in idol worship may have hindered Jacob from fully seeking God, but the sad story of Dinah was what God used in Jacob's life, to wake him up from his spiritual slumber. God used this event to put him on the path of reconciliation and consecration to God. This story stands as a clear reminder that the way out of spiritual slump is responding obediently to God's word.\n\nThis chapter also serves, once again, as a great reminder of the persistence of God to keep His promises. Jacob had got himself into trouble again, and God, once again, was there to lead him out and back into relationship with Him. Significantly, Jacob called God the one \"who answers me in the day of my distress and who has been with me where I have gone.\" This statement is a good summary of God's interaction throughout the Jacob narrative. Throughout this chapter, there is a focus on God's past and continuing mercies towards Jacob. God's protection of Jacob from his brother is mentioned three times in this chapter. When God speaks to Jacob again at Bethel, He repeats what He has already promised him and reveals His name, \"El Shaddai,\" to Jacob. This is the same name that God revealed to Abraham and Isaac; it means, \"God Almighty.\" This name acted as a reminder to Jacob that God was sufficient for all of his needs. Sometimes we think that we need to discover some new spiritual truths to get out of our spiritual decline. That is seldom the case. Usually, we just need to be reminded of the old truths we already know and turn to seek the Lord again.\n \n1. What steps did Jacob and his family have to take to get back on the right path with God?\n2. What are the difficulties that Jacob faced in chapter 35, and how do they help conclude this part of his story?\n3. When has God used difficult circumstances or poor choices to help you draw near to Him?\n\n**Gen. 36 – Making friends with the world will make you an enemy of God.**\n\nThis part of Jacob's life ends with a short history of his brother Esau's family. There is a stark contrast between the Kingdom of Esau and the tribes of Israel. In verse thirty-one, God makes the point that Esau's sons, who walked away from God, had the distinction of being kings long before Jacob's sons, to whom it was promised. In fact, while Esau's family grew in power, Jacob's sons were a nation of slaves in Egypt. Nonetheless, there is also in this story the testimony of God's faithfulness to bless Abraham's seed as He had promised.\n\nIt is essential to see the relationship of Esau to Edom. God wanted His people to see what results when a man lives apart from Him.\nEsau was a likable, kind, and successful man from the world's perspective. However, Esau's decision to walk away from God resulted in the growth of the godless nation, which plagues Israel throughout the Old Testament. If we seek friendship with the world and worldly prosperity, we will fail with God. If, however, we are willing to wait patiently for God to fulfill His covenant promises and labour for the coming Kingdom, we will succeed in what matters most to God.\n\n\n1. What are God's three main promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?\n2. What stands out to you about this chapter when comparing it to the story of Jacob?\n3. How do you reconcile the epitaph of Esau in this chapter with the blessing that Isaac gave Esau in Genesis chapter 27?\n\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n\n**James 4:1–10 The conflict around us comes from the war within us.**\n\nJacob learned the consequences of taking your eyes off the Lord. When you make yourself a friend of the world, you are an enemy of God. And when you are outside of God's fellowship, you suffer the consequences of sin. But because of God's enduring grace, He shows Jacob the path to reconciliation with God.\n\nIn his letter to the diaspora, James points to the root of the conflict in our lives. Whenever followers of God want to align themselves with the world, they invite controversy. As we align ourselves with the world, we come to desire the things the world has to offer, which sparks envy and covetousness in our lives. I do not think James was accusing his readers of actually murdering anyone.\nJames warns believers of the ultimate consequences of living merely to satisfy personal desires. What makes the world so appealing and yet dangerous is that the pursuit of passions is seen as virtuous.\n\nYet, James does not paint a hopeless picture of those who have fallen in the pursuit of sinful passions. He points to the road that leads to a life of peace and joy with God. God yearns jealously to have us commit ourselves entirely to Him. He is worthy of our allegiance, and allegiance to Him yields the greatest blessing and protects us from those passions that are aroused in, and pursued by us when we befriend the world.\n \n\n1. What is the principal or central idea of these verses?\n2. According to James, what steps do we need to take to free ourselves from friendship with the world?\n3. What signs in your life indicate that you are too \"friendly\" with the world?\n\n$$$$$$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Without a glance his way, she ran straight into the arms of her mother, Leah and disappeared together into her tent. Distraught over the cries of his beautiful daughter, Jacob waited outside the tent, eager to find out what had transpired in Shechem. Eventually, Leah came out. “What happened to Dinah?” he asked. “Is she hurt? Was she attacked on the road? Was it an animal?” \n\nFar less agitated, but nevertheless deeply grieved, Leah waited patiently to speak. “Yes, she was attacked,” Leah explained, her voice choked by tears. “But she was not attacked by just anyone, it was the prince who hurt her.”\n\n“Shechem did this? Hamor’s son?” Jacob asked. But Leah could not look her husband in the eye. A mix of anger and shame on behalf of her daughter stirred within her. “How foolish of her to go into the city alone. What inspired her to leave the safety of our camp and go there?” Jacob continued, trying to sort out the details.\n\n“She was curious. She wanted to see how the women around here lived. Obviously, she is humiliated and regrets that she went alone,” Leah explained and then returned to the tent to comfort Dinah. \n\nFurious with Prince Shechem, Jacob’s first instinct was to avenge his daughter immediately. But then he considered the repercussions of that. His household was small compared to that of Shechem and the surrounding cities. The same fear that had plagued him before meeting his brother began to agitate his stomach once again. So, he held his peace and did nothing, awaiting his sons return from the field. Meanwhile, to his surprise, King Hamor arrived, accompanied by his son Shechem. Jacob had pitched his tents less than a day’s journey outside the city of Shechem. So, their swift arrival marked the severity of the situation. Nevertheless, Jacob received his guests with the typical hospitality due royalty, all the while maintaining his composure. For he knew that when his sons returned, all sense of peace would be lost. \n\n“This is outrageous!” Simeon shouted as he arrived in a cloud of rage with Levi right behind him. The brothers were damp from sweat and their clothes dirty from their hasty journey home from the field. Then Simeon caught sight of Shechem, enjoying himself under the shade of his father’s tent and pointed to him saying, “You!...You have brought shame upon our family!” Simeon growled at him with a frightening tone. As Simeon approached him, Shechem tried not to cower beneath the anger that seemed to burn in his eyes. \n\n“My soul is drawn to your sister. She is truly special,” Shechem pleaded. Simeon burned even hotter at Shechem’s attempt to defend himself. How could he even say that after what he had done to her, Simeon thought to himself. If this conversation had taken place in the field, he might have struck him down right then and there. \n\nShechem’s father, Hamor, stepped forward, attempting to cool the situation between the two young men. “Clearly, the soul of my son desires your daughter. Many young women in this city long for my son’s attention. It’s honor that he has chosen her. Please, I ask you, give her to him to be his wife,” he implored Jacob.\n\nSimeon and Levi could no longer contain their rage, “An honor? You think it would be an honor, after the mountain of shame you have heaped upon her?” Levi shouted. \n\nHamor, coolly dismissed their convictions and made an offer, “A union between my son and your daughter can be mutually beneficial to both our families. Let us make marriages between more than just Shechem and Dinah. I offer our daughters to you, and you give us yours. Let us join our families together and dwell together. The land is open for you to dwell in it and use it as you wish.”\n\nThen Shechem stepped forward and pleaded once again, “Please, give me a chance, I will give you whatever you want if you give me your sister.”\n\nConsidering the devastating situation Jacob was tempted by such a generous offer, but he remained silent, waiting to see his son’s reaction. It wasn’t hard to figure out what Simeon and Levi thought of Hamor’s offer. Simeon’s jaw was set, revealing his characteristic stubbornness, as he quickly exited the tent with Levi at his heels. Although he was proud of his son’s convictions, Jacob couldn’t help but desire peace between the two families. He knew his son’s well and it was vengeance they wanted before there would be any peace. Jacob sighed as he walked out into the dark of the night in search of them. He hadn’t gone far when he walked right into Simeon and Levi on their way back to the tent. To Jacob’s surprise, they looked considerably calmer. \n\n“We have found a solution, Father,” Levi said, as he and Simeon continued walking towards the tent. “If they want to marry our sister, then they must become like us. We cannot give her to someone who is uncircumcised,” he explained. \n\nAs they re-entered the tent, Simeon spoke up first, “We belong to Yahweh, and he has commanded us to be circumcised. Therefore, we cannot give our sister in marriage to someone who is uncircumcised, this would bring even more shame upon our people. But, if you were to become like us, we could consider giving our sister to you. So long as every male among you is circumcised. Then we will also give our daughters to you as wives and we will take yours, dwelling together in this land, becoming one people. But if you will not be circumcised, then forget your desires. There will be no marriage because we will take Dinah and leave this place.”\n\n“Yes, we will do it!” Hamor said without hesitating, relieved that they had finally agreed to his son’s wishes. As a token of the agreement they had reached, they sat together and shared a meal. As they sat together in the tent, Simeon gave Levi a knowing grin. Levi returned the look with a quick wink as he hid his smile behind the cup he was drinking from. \n\nThe following day, Jacob received news that the men of the city had agreed to be circumcised. Shechem was highly favored among the people, so when he and his father spoke at the gate, the men listened. Hamor had convinced the people that they would greatly benefit from Israel’s livestock and their women once they came together as one people. \n\nAs Leah prepared to send her daughter away to be married, Dinah concealed her fear and despair behind her veil as she exited her mother’s tent, she was greeted by her brothers who were waiting to say goodbye. As Simeon embraced her, he whispered, “We will come for you.” Dinah looked up into her brothers’ eyes. Hope, mixed with confusion flashed across her face. Simeon only placed a finger to his lips, requesting her silence and stepped away, watching as she mounted her camel and rode into the city.\n\t \n**Who was Dinah?** Dinah was the daughter of Jacob and Leah. The sister of Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah.\n\n**How did Jacob respond to his daughter’s attack? How did her brother’s respond?** Jacob was very concerned about conflict arising between his growing nation and the city of Shechem. His sons reacted very differently. They were outwardly angry over the way their sister had been treated. \n\n**How could Jacob have responded differently to the situation. Would a different response have kept his son’s from lying?** We will see throughout the story, that Jacob is more concerned with the opinions of others around him, than protecting his daughter. If he had rejected the King’s offer in the beginning and left the city, it might have prevented his sons from plotting revenge.\n\n**Day 2 - Genesis 34:25-31**\n\n\nThree days had passed since the men of Shechem had circumcised themselves. A quietness had descended upon the city while they kept to their beds, restrained by the pain of their wounds. Simeon and Levi stood waiting with a group of their most trusted servants outside the walls, their hands clutching their swords at their side. Their plan of revenge was working out perfeclty. Night was almost upon them as they entered the gates, moving silently from house to house, striking down every male in the city. They were so fast and lethal that they had been through over half of the homes before they heard the first cries from the women and children. Eventually they came to Hamor and his son Shechem, striking them down in their sleep. In one swift move Simeon pulled her sister out of bed and carried her out of the house and through the city gates. As she was placed back on her feet she stood releaved to see her brothers, but shaken by the carnage around her. As they mounted their horses Judah and and Reuben rode up with more of their servants, armed for battle. \n\n“So, it was you two who have crushed this city,” Reuben said to them. “We heard the screams from our camp. It’s only right, for they defiled you, Dinah!” \n\nSimeon and Levi continued out of the city, blood on their hands as Reuben and the other eight captured the women and children who were left and plundered the livestock, food, and all their possessions. \n\nWhen Jacob caught sight of his two sons returning from Shechem with Dinah, he ran out to meet them shouting, “What have you done! You fools! You have brought so much trouble on me! The people of Shechem are not the only ones who live around here! The Canaanites and the Perizzites will want revenge when they see what you have done! Our household is small. If they attack us, we will surely be destroyed!”\n\nHis jaw set, once again, Simeon resisted him saying, “That’s what you care about? That we maintain peace? Don’t you care that Shechem treated our sister like a prostitute?”\n\t\n**Who attacked the city of Shechem?** Simeon and Levi\n\n**How did Simeon and Levi deceive Hamor and Shechem?** Simeon and Levi promised that if the men of Shechem were circumcised, Shechem could have Dinah as his wife and the two peoples could become one. But instead, Simeon and Levi had planned to kill all the men once they were circumcised because they would be weak and sore.\n\n**How did Jacob’s other nine sons participate in the attack?**  The other nine brothers came into Shechem after the men were killed and took everything else for themselves.\n\t\n**Day 3 - Genesis 35:1-15**\n\nThe fear that had crept in only days before had once again taken control of Jacob. Distraught over his son’s actions and the repercussions it would bring upon him, he knew his only defense was Yahweh. “Help, Lord! You have always answered me when I am in distress, and you have been with me wherever I go. I ask you again, protect me,” Jacob cried out as he looked across the valley towards Shechem. In the distance, his sons were on the road, headed towards him. They brought with them women and children, livestock and treasures but left behind a city engulfed in flames. Suddenly Jacob felt a heavy arm upon his shoulder. As he turned his head, he recognized the man that he had wrestled with so many years ago standing before him. Jacob immediately fell to his knees, bowing his head before his Lord. In a low and gentle voice Yahweh asked, “How do you think it came to this?” Jacob had no answer for him, but the Lord was not looking for an answer. A moment passed and Yahweh looked down at Jacob crouched beneath him and said, “Arise Jacob, go to Bethel and dwell there. Do not forget your vow to me. Remember when I appeared to you there as you fled from your brother Esau? Make an altar at Bethel and worship me.”\n\nWhen Jacob looked up, Yahweh was gone. His attempts to stand failed as a wave of conviction rushed over him. The memory of his dream nearly 30 years ago seemed so clear. He would never forget the ladder with God’s angels coming in and out of heaven. Yahweh was clearly the One who created all things, the one true God, yet he had allowed Rachel to bring her father’s idols into their home. On top of that he had led his family to dwell near this city who did not worship Yahweh. His body began to shake, and sobs came deep from within him. He had agreed to join with the people of Shechem, the Canaanites, whom God had specifically instructed his family not to intermarry with. The destruction of the city before him was his fault he realized. His permissiveness to let the worship of idols infiltrate his home had begun a ripple effect which had led to this point. The shame of his actions caused him to tear at his clothes as he walked back to his camp, ready to obey Yahweh’s words and fulfill his vow to the only one worthy of allegiance…Yahweh.\n\nJacob’s oldest son saw his father’s distraught look as he walked into camp. Before he could ask, Jacob barked “Gather everyone!” So, Reuben ran off, calling everyone in the camp to come together. “Things are going to change here. You are to get rid of every foreign god among you and everything that’s associated with their worship. They have defiled my house! You must purify yourselves. Wash and change your clothes. Then we will pack up and go to Bethel. There I will make an altar to Yahweh, for he is unlike these foreign gods. He is a God who answers me when I need help and has been with me wherever I go. So, bring me your idols and do it now!”\n\nJacob went straight to the terebinth tree that had so graciously shaded them since they had arrived near Shechem. He looked up at the leaves shivering in the breeze as he briefly remembered hearing his grandfather Abraham talking about a meeting with Yahweh under a similar tree in a very similar place. Could this be that tree, he wondered, as the breeze caused him to shiver as well? If so, it would be fitting to leave their gods in a place where Yahweh dwelled. His shovel made a crunching sound as it slid into the earth. One scoop after another, Jacob piled the dirt higher and higher as his hole beneath the tree grew deeper and deeper. Then, one by one, his servants, sons, daughters, and wives brought their amulets, their figurines, and the rings for their ears. Everything related to the worship of other gods went in the hole. Even Rachel appeared before Jacob, holding the household gods she had stolen from her father, Laban. \n\nWhen Jacob caught sight of them, his face hardened. “It was you, Rachel! You are the one who stole them! How could you! They could have cost you your life,” he shouted. \n\n“They are my Terephim, Jacob. I can’t possibly let them go, they are too precious to me,” Rachel explained. Clutching the figures to her chest as a tear slid down her cheek. \n\n“Put them in the ground Rachel,” Jacob growled at her, leaving no room for argument. Hesitantly, Rachel tossed them in the hole, weeping as Jacob began to cover them with dirt. \n\nWithin days, they had left behind their idols buried beneath the terebinth and began their journey south. Determination propelled Jacob onward, despite his fear of the surrounding cities looking for revenge. To his surprise, the trek was peaceful. Due to the Lord’s work, a great fear of Jacob’s household had settled over the tribes. So, they arrived in Bethel swiftly and safely. \n\nLeaving his wives and servants to set up their camp, Jacob searched for the pillar he had built long ago when he had promised to worship Yahweh and give him a portion of everything, he blessed him with. But Jacob found only a small mound of stones that had once been stacked high. So, he began to rebuild, although this time it was no longer just a pillar but a great altar. When it was complete, Jacob looked up to heaven and said, “Once again, I name this place, ‘El-bethel’, because this is where Yahweh revealed himself to me when I was running from my brother many years ago.” Then, without warning, the Lord appeared before him. This time, however, Yahweh appeared to him like he had the first time, bright, majestic and beautiful. Jacob fell on his face in fear of God. There was a moment of silence that felt like an eternity. Then God said, “Your name is Jacob. But you will no longer be called Jacob. I said it when you contended with me on the banks of the Jabbok, and I say it again, your name shall now be Israel. I am El Shaddai, God Almighty, and just like I commanded your father and your grandfather before him, I command you to be fruitful and multiply. Nations and kings will come from you. The land I gave to your grandfather Abraham and your father Isaac, I give to you, and then I will give it to your children after you.”\n\nWhen Yahweh had finished reaffirming his promise to Jacob, he went up to heaven as quickly as he had come. Then, taking a jar of wine, Jacob lifted it above the stone table and poured it over the top of the altar as a drink offering in honor of the Lord.\n\n**What did Jacob do when God told him to pack up and go to Bethel to worship him?** Jacob told his household to wash themselves and he got rid of their idols. This is called consecration. This means they separated themselves from anything that would contaminate their relationship with God. This signified Jacob’s repentance after the violence in Shechem.\n\n**Are there things in your life that distract you from your relationship with God?** Which things can you ‘bury’ like Jacob? Our world is full of distractions that keep us from fulfilling God’s will for our lives.  \n\n**Why did God tell Jacob to leave Shechem and go to Bethel?** Jacob had made a vow to worship the Lord his God over twenty years ago but had been distracted by the pagan worshipers surrounding him, so God commanded him to return to Bethel and build an altar to worship him.\n\n**What did God promise Jacob?** God reaffirmed the promise he had made to Abraham and Isaac. He promised Jacob that he would become a nation and he would give him land and many offspring.\n\n** Day 4 - Genesis 35:16- 36:43**\n\nAfter Jacob, now known as Israel, had built the altar at Bethel, he moved his household further south towards the home of his father Isaac. But along the way when they were nearing the city of Bethlehem, Rachel who was carrying her second child, went into labor. She labored and labored, but the delivery was hard, causing her body to shut down. Finally, with her hardest and last push, her midwife said, “Don’t fear, Rachel, God has blessed you with a son!” \n\nA flicker of joy in her eyes, Rachel breathed her last words, “I will call him Ben-oni, for he has used up all my strength.” Her words drifted off as her soul departed.\n\nThat day, Jacob was left with his twelfth son, whom he called, not Ben-oni but Benjamin. He had lost his most beloved wife, yet he had gained a son. With sadness he buried Rachel outside Bethlehem, leaving a pillar to mark her tomb. \n\nThen he took his twelve sons, his wives, and the rest of his growing nation to Hebron, where they lived many years at his father house. \n\n**Where was Jacob headed after he built his altar at Bethel?** He was going to his father Isaac’s house in Hebron. Jacob had asked the Lord to bring him back there when he fled from Esau.\n\n**How had the Lord fulfilled his promise to Jacob?** God had always been with Jacob, even amid the sin of his sons and his failures. He had provided and protected Jacob and his family. The Lord had brought Jacob safely back to his home in Hebron as a growing nation.\n\t\n**Jacob and his family became friends with the cities around them, allowing sin to entangle them. Nevertheless, When Jacob called upon the Lord, God remained steadfast in his love and reaffirmed his promise to make him a mighty nation. When followers of Jesus desire friendship with the world it only leads to sin. When you confess and draw near to God he forgives and draws near to you.**"

A wedding is a special celebration because marriage is very special to God.\n\n When the Lord God made man, he dug up some earth and carefully formed it.\n God breathed on him and the man came to life. He called him Adam. Then the Lord planted a special garden in Eden for his man to live, filling it with beautiful trees, and plants that produced food. He said to Adam, “This garden is for you to enjoy. Work the ground and care for this place. However, I have one rule for you to remember. There is one tree that you are not allowed to eat from. This is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat from this tree, you will die. You may eat from every other tree here, just not that one.”\n\nSo, Adam worked joyfully, naming all the beautiful animals in the world. The first one came with soft golden fur. He let out a giant...\n roooaaar! ... as he came towards Adam. So, Adam named him, Lion. Next, he heard a sound of galloping hoofs approaching. A large animal with four legs and a flowing tale raced by ...\n neigh! He called this one, Horse. Then, Adam looked up to see a giant bird silently soar ing overhead with colorful feathers and a sharp, hooked beak. He named it, Eagle.\nBut then Adam asked, “Why is there no one like me?” So, the Lord took part of Adam and formed a woman.\nThen like a father presenting his daughter to her groom, the Lord brought the woman to Adam. Overjoyed, he exclaimed, “Finally, here is someone for me! She is unlike any of the other animals because she was made from a part of me. I will call her Woman.”\n\n**Finally, creation was complete with a husband and wife.

Then, looking into the man’s face, God breathed into his nose the breath of life. Opening his eyes, the man saw the face of his creator as he came to life.\n\nGod planted a special garden in Eden for his man to live, filling it with beautiful trees, and plants that produce d food.\n He said to Adam, “This garden is for you to enjoy.\n Work the ground and care for this place.

These verses set the scene set the scene for the place and purposes of God’s highest creation. God creates all things, and yet he leaves plenty of work for his image bearers to accomplish.\n\n1. Follow the verbs. In these verses who is doing the acting and who are what is begin acted upon?\n2. From what is written, describe the difference between the world at that time compared to what it is today?\n3. Describe the unique way in which God created man. How was it different from the rest of creation?\n\n\n**Genesis 2: 8 - 17 - God creates a garden of plentiful.**\n\nIn chapter 1 Moses introduces God as “Elohim” which means “Mighty one”. In chapter 2 Moses uses the name that people of Israel would have recognized, “Yahweh” which means “Promise-Keeping One”. Taking the time to describe the place and conditions of the home God provided for Adam is essential for the people of Israel to understanding the nature of God and their relationship with him. Furthermore, God plants a tree in the garden to remind man of God’s world, with God’s other creatures, on God’s terms.”\n\n1. What does the text say God provided for Adam in the garden?\n2. God created a home for Adam. What does that tell us about the relationship between God and his image bearer?\n3. How does the tree of the knowledge of good and evil remind man of God’s sovereign authority?\n\n\n\n**Genesis 2: 18-24 - God creates Eve**\n\nMoses repeats the phrase “and God saw that it was good” five times through the first chapter, and one time at the end of the chapter declaring that everything he made was “very good”. These statements are contrasted with verse 18 when God declares that “it is not good that man should be alone.” Only with the creation of both man and woman and the establishment of the family do we have completeness in creation. Man and woman together in the Garden with God was the finishing touch of creation.\n\n1. What was Adam doing when God saw that he should not be alone? What did he need?\n2. What made Eve different and yet the same as Adam?\n3. How is the relationship between man and woman described in these verses?\n\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n\n**Ephesians 5: 22-33 - Marriage points to Christ and his Church.**\n\nIn this passage Paul describes a mystery previously hidden but now through Christ has been brought to light. The relationship that exists between a husband and his wife is the same as the one that exists between christ and those who are saved by faith (the Church). Paul uses the word “submit” to describe the command that wives have concerning their husbands. This word means to help her husband and rest under his leadership. This is how the church submits to Christ. In like manner the command that Paul gives the husband concerning his wife is “love”. This kind of love (agape) means to seek the highest good for another person. Husbands are to treat their wives like Christ treats his church.\n\n1. Who does the husband represent? Who does the wife represent?\n2. Looking at Genesis 2 and Ephesians 5, what words describe the role of the wife and what words describe the role of the husband?\n3. How would a marriage that reflects these passages teach others about the relationship between Jesus and his church?\n\n**Action!** Pray for the families in the church. Ask the Lord to help every spouse live out the role God created for them in marriage. Praise Jesus for seeking the highest good for his church by giving his life on the cross for our sins.\n\n$$$$$$$\n\n\n\n",

So much time and history has passed, we are left with only a glimpse of the context in which Noah and his family lived before the flood. The creation in both the physical world and spiritual realm work together to defy the creator. The only thing multiplying faster than mankind was the speed at which humans were being corrupted.  To add to this corruption, the sons of God (fallen angels) saw and took wives from the daughters of men. This unholy union violated the created order and corrupted God’s purpose for marriage and procreation. The world had fallen so far into sin that God decided to start the countdown to its destruction. It seems the only righteous man on the planet was Noah, who along with his family, would be God’s chosen man to experience God’s protection from the flood.  \n\n1. How does the writer describe life for Noah and his family before the flood?\n2. Why did God instruct Noah to build the ark?\n3. Why did God give Noah the task to build the ark instead of doing it for him?\n\n**Genesis 7 – God is faithful to preserve Noah and his family.**\n\nIf we look back to Genesis chapter 1, the story of creation begins with the Spirit of God hovering over the face of the water. Before God set creation in order the earth was in a state of barrenness and chaos. Because of the increase of evil in the world God reverts everything back to this chaos, washing it clean with water, save for one ark full of animals and a family of 8.  What this chapter clearly tells us is that sinful people do not deserve to live on God’s earth. What God created as good, mankind used for violence and evil. God, in His holiness, acted in holy judgment and destroyed his beloved creation, so that he could begin again in mercy towards Noah and his family.\n\n1. What details are given to reveal the size and scope of the flood?\n2. What does this chapter reveal to us about the severity of sin?\n3. What are the indicators of Noah’s righteousness?\n\n\n**Genesis 8:1-19 – Noah demonstrates patience in suffering.**\n\nAlthough Noah and his family were safe inside the ark, we can only imagine what they had to suffer as they waited for the flood to subside. It is hard to imagine what life was like inside the ark. The people inside knew they were the only ones left on the earth, and yet the day-to-day task of caring for the animals, and the drudge of living in an ark without a paddle or sail must have been a test of patience and faith. The transition from flood to aftermath of the flood begins with God “remembering Noah”. Moses did not believe God forgot about Noah and his family, but rather he extended mercy to them by delivering them from death. This “remembering” is the same language used to describe God’s deliverance of Israel in Exodus. God never forgets those whom he loves but knows exactly when to act on their behalf, for their good. While waiting, Noah tries to assess his situation by sending out a raven and then a dove. The reasons for sending out the raven are not given in the text. Since there was much death caused by the flood, Noah may have sent the raven out to see if it would find carcasses on the water to eat from. Contrasted with the raven, the dove signified life and hope. God considers doves clean animals because they do not eat flesh. So, Noah must have known that its survival depended on dry land and vegetation. What the dove brought back was a promise of hope.\n\n1. How long were Noah and his family in the ark? \n2. What did the olive leaf communicate to Noah and his family?\n3. How is God acting on behalf of Noah and his family?\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n**1 Peter 3:18-22 – The ark gives us an understanding of the Gospel and a theology of suffering.**\n\nIn this passage, Peter is writing to a group of first century Christians who were suffering because of their faith in Jesus. No doubt this suffering was spurred on by their public testimony of faith in baptism. Peter is reminding them that Jesus also suffered unjustly, but that in his death he proclaimed his victory over sin to those spirits who rebelled against God in the days of Noah. Peter then uses symbolic language to relate the believer’s position in Christ to Noah and his family being kept safe in the ark. He was not saying they were saved through their water baptism, but that their faith in Jesus is their “ark of salvation” from God’s punishment for sin. Just as Jesus suffered the punishment of sin on our behalf, so too the ark that Noah built, took the punishment of the watery destruction in Noah’s day. We who are in Christ, like Noah and his family, are kept safe from God’s punishment for sin. Peter’s point was to teach the persecuted Christians that their suffering can be the context and testimony of Christ's victory.\n\n1. How is the ark a metaphor of the Gospel?\n2. What does this passage teach us about suffering?\n3. What does this teach us about the meaning of baptism?\n\n$$$$$$$",

We can drink water and we also use it for washing.\n A long time ago, the Lord used a great deal of water for washing the earth clean.\n After Cain hurt his brother, more and more people became like Cain. They hated God and hurt one another.\n The sin became so bad, that every person on earth had only evil in his heart, but there was one man who loved and obeyed God. His name was Noah. One day, the Lord came to Noah and said, “ I am sad over what has happened to my beloved creation.\n So, I will destroy the earth with a flood and wash it clean.\n But, don’t be scared Noah, I favor you. You and your family, including your sons and their wives won't be punished. You must build an ark for your family and two of each kind of animal and bird. It will bring you safely through the water.”\n\nDoing just as the Lord said, Noah and his sons built the ark. The day before the rain came, into the ark went: Noah and his family, a pair of lions, a pair of lambs, a pair of cranes, a pair of canaries and many other creatures.\n Then God caused it to rain for 40 days and 40 nights. The earth shook and water poured out from underground until it covered the entire earth and up to the highest mountain.\n The giant ship rocked and rolled over the waves, but Noah and his family were safe, just as God promised.\n After the rain stopped, Noah sent out a dove to see if the land was dry. The dove returned with a fresh olive leaf. Then, Noah sent the dove out again, but it did not return. Noah knew the dove had found dry land to make a nest. Finally, after living in the ark for more than a year, the Lord told Noah he could leave.\n Then out of the ark went: Noah and his family, a pair of lions, a pair of lambs, a pair of cranes, a pair of canaries and many other creatures that creep on the earth.\n\n**Jesus is like the ark. We find safety in him.**\n \n",

Death was a constant reminder of Adam’s disobedience in the garden and the curse which followed.\n Noah’s shoulders began to shake as grief overtook his ordinarily stoic demeanor.\n His grandfather had taught him everything he knew about Yahweh.\n The last of the men to walk and worship with Adam, Methus elah’s death signified the end of Adam’s influence.\n Adam had passed down everything about his life in the garden and what it was like to walk so closely with Yahweh.\n Although Noah had come along much later, the teachings of Adam and the faithful men who followed laid a foundation of faith throughout his 600 - year life span.\n Stories of his great grandfather Enoch’s walk with God had inspired the conviction to walk in the way of Yahweh despite the hostility it brought from the corrupt world around him.\n Like the yoke of an oxen, Noah felt a heaviness descend upon him. His shoulders ceased to shake and instead tightened as he began to grasp the reality that he alone was left to carry, and pass on the knowledge of Yahweh.\n \nNoah looked up to heaven and sighed, as his wife took his hand in hers. “ Come, Emzara,” Noah said, turning to walk back towards the ark. “We must finish with the preparations. I think the water is coming soon .” While they walked, Noah’s mind wandered back to the day when Yahweh had first visited him.\n That meeting, one hundred years ago, had changed the course of his life.\n Noah had always been burdened over the state of the world around him. Year after year, cities grew and multiplied but sin seemed to multiply even faster and it bore horrendous violence.\n Apathy had become hatred towards the One who had created all things.\n Only love for themselves remained.\n Even families no longer resembled what Yahweh had designed in Adam and Eve.\n So, he wasn’t surprised when Yahweh had told him he would put an end to it all.\n Truly grieved, he had said to Noah, “ I will destroy the earth with a flood.\n But, don’t fear Noah, I favor you. You and your family, including your sons and their wives will receive mercy.\n You must build an ark...” Noah’s memory faded away when he and Emzara had reached the place they called home. It was where he and his sons had lived and worked for the past 100 years.\n The heaviness persisted, as he looked up at the massive ship that was only days away from completion.\n Noah spoke under his breath, “Lord, Yahweh, I did all that you commanded.\n 135 meters is its length.\n It is 23 meters wide with three levels.\n The roof is completed and my sons are finishing the door.\n When will the water come? For years I have warned so many of the destruction you said was coming, they only laugh in my face now.\n Maybe I am as crazy as they think I am.\n ” Only silence answered Noah’s cry of confusion. He continued towards the ark, climbing the ramp, he entered the partially mounted door.\n Crouched over a mound of grain, was Emzara and his three daughters-in-law.\n They were busy adding the recent harvest to the ample supply of food they had already stored away.\n Grabbing a sack of grain, Noah followed them through the ark up to the second level to the storage rooms.\n The women had dried fruit, collected nuts, harvested vegetables, and seeds.\n “Do you think this will be enough ?” Emzara asked.\n Overwhelmed by what God had provided, Noah said, “I don’t know how long we will be in the ark or how many animals will enter , but it looks like more than enough to me.” \n\n“Medah,” Shem called to his wife. “Come help us with this door.” Shem, the oldest of Noah’s sons, and his two y ounger brothers were fitting the final portion of ark into place.\n Medah and Noah went back down to the entrance to see how they could help. After two hours of pushing, pulling, and adjusting, the men finally got the door in its proper place. The sun was setting as Noah gathered his family close. “ For years and years, we have worked to do all that the Lord has commanded us to do. Finally, the ark is completed! Let us join hands and give thanks to Yahweh !” Noah said with a joyful shout.\n\nThat night, Noah suddenly woke from his sleep. He stepped outside his tent and found Yahweh waiting for him.\n “Walk with me, Noah,” he beckoned. Heart racing, Noah fell in stride next to Yahweh. “ I have found you to be a righteous man, Noah. You have believed my words concerning the destruction that awaits the earth.\n ”Yahweh looked up at the ark. “ Completing this ark, just as I commanded you, has demonstrated your faith in me.”\n\n“I have called on people to repent of their sin, but they just laugh and think I am crazy,” Noah explained. “You alone are the only righteous one left in this generation. I have come to tell you; the time has come to enter the ark with your family. Take with you seven pairs of the clean animals, a male and a female of each kind and two each of the unclean animals, a male and female. Bring also seven pairs of birds of the sky, so their offspring will survive on the earth. In seven days, I will send rain on the earth. It will rain for 40 days and 40 nights and every living thing I have made I will destroy from the face of the ground.” Noah shivered as he lowered himself to his knees. “Thank you, Lord, for your mercy towards me.” Noah felt a hand on his shoulder but when he raised his head, Yahweh was gone.\n\n\nUnable to go back to sleep, Noah rose before the sun, only to find animals gathered around the ark. When Shem, Ham, and Japheth joined him they opened the heavy door and led the animals to the rooms they had prepared. The next morning, even more arrived, as if they knew trouble was coming and sensed the ark was a place of refuge. Each day that week, more and more animals and birds showed up, waiting to enter the ark.\n By the sixth day, every animal had gone into the ark. Noah, Emzara, and their sons and their sons's wives entered the ark with the last of their food and possessions. That afternoon, Noah stood at the door, warning the crowd that had gathered one last time, but they remained outside the ark, entertained by the circus before them. Sadly, Noah took one last look at all of God’s creation, before God shut the door.\n\nWhen the sun had set that evening, Noah and his family began to feel a slight tremor coming from beneath the ship. The slight tremors got stronger as the ground beneath them started to convulse.\n Emzara ran to the skylight to see what was happening.\n She opened the window to see a giant wall of water rushing towards them.\n It was like a river that had sprung out of the ground.\n “No, Emzara, close the window,” Noah shouted, as rain began to beat against the side of the ark. The sound was like stones dropping from heaven. They had never heard anything like it. “Everyone, brace yourselves,” Shem called out. Ham and Japheth grabbed the frame of the ship wrapping themselves tightly with their wives. All of a sudden, the ark lurched sideways, throwing them across the room. Noah and his sons quickly got a better grip, ready for the next pitch. This time the ark jerked forward and seemed to rise, but another wave hit them from the side forcing the ship to tip sideways. Everything rolled to the side. A sound of groaning and wailing came from the decks below, as the animals rolled with the ship.\n “Lord!” Noah cried. “ Please don’t let us capsize!” The ark continued to pitch sideways, but the force of each roll lessened as the water rose at a steadier pace.\n\n\nThey clung to the frame of the ark for the next several days. Finally, the chaos of the waters began to settle and the reality of their new home began to sink in. But weeks later, the beating sound of the rain continued. Noah and his sons spent most of their days in the lower decks with the animals. It looked as if they were settling into their temporary home. The ship seemed to have rocked many of them into a hibernation-type sleep. Noah’s wife and daughters stayed busy preparing meals and collecting water from the skylight for drinking. Every morning, Emzara, would push the small window open and poke her head out into the rain to see the hilltops which remained around them, but every day the water rose higher as they floated above it in their faithful ark until finally, one - day, she could no longer see any land around them. Only water remained.\n\nAfter 40 days and nights, the rain stopped. The gentle thudding that had begun to soothe them to sleep at night ceased, nothing but the low rumbling of earth and water was heard.\n The earth seemed to be shifting beneath them and day by day Emzara caught glimpses of new mountain peaks, poking their heads from the great depths as the water continued to rise beneath them eventually covering those as well.\n Tensions amongst Noah’s sons and daughters had been high in the confines of the ship.\n Without the rain, the air became stagnant with the smell of death from the floating carcasses.\n\n“Father, what will happen when we can finally leave the ark ?” Ham anxiously asked one day.\n “It could be years before the water goes down. Will we have to live in the mountains? How can we possibly grow food there? There is rotten flesh everywhere.”\n\n“Ham, there is no need to worry, ” Noah calmly answered.\n “Remember the favor we have with the Lord.\n He has brought us through the water safely. Yahweh has provided everything for us, just as he promised. We must trust that he will continue to care for us.” Disgruntled that his father would not join in his concerns, Ham continued to stew over the future.\n Noah knew it could be months before they were able to land on dry ground. It had been 80 days since the flooding began, then 80 turned into 100 and 100 turned into 120 and still the water increased.\n Ham’s anxiety had made him more and more restless. Unsuccessfully, Shem tried to calm him with reminders of Yahweh’s mercy and grace towards them, but Ham continued to believe he had forgotten them.\n\nEventually, the clouds cleared and with the warmth of the sun came fresh anticipation of exiting the ark. It had been 150 days since they had entered and on that day a wind began to blow and with it blew away the smell of death. Slowly, the waters began to recede and after a couple months, they could finally see the tops of the mountains.\n So, Noah waited another 40 days and then went below to where the birds were kept. He found his pair of ravens, who had become many more than two during their time in the ark. He took the male with him up to the top floor and opening the window, he set him free over the water. “Will he return?” Shem asked. “I will wait and see. There is plenty of food for him drifting on the water,” replied Noah. When the raven did not return, he sent out a dove to see if the waters had subsided from the ground. But the dove returned. “The water must still be over the ground,” Noah said to his sons, who were anxiously awaiting news. “We will wait and then send her out again.” Noah took the gentle bird back to her roost below. Seven days later he returned to gather her up again. Once again, he sent the dove out the window of the ark to look for dry ground. Shem and his wife, Medah, remained by the window, awaiting the birds return. “If she doesn’t come back, does that mean she found dry ground?” Medah asked. “ It means she has found somewhere to roost with fresh food. She won’t feed on anything dead, like the raven. So, if she doesn’t find food, she will return. Doves always know their way home,” Shem told her. That evening the dove returned. Catching sight of her in the distance, Medah called out, “Noah, Noah, she has returned and I think she has something in her beak.” E eagerly, Noah rushed back to the window, just in time for the dove to land on his arm. Then into his hand she dropped a freshly picked olive leaf.\n “Do you know what this means?” Noah asked his family, who had gathered around. “It means the waters have subsided!” All eight of them, shouted with joy and praised the Lord. “It won’t be long now,” said Noah. So, he waited another seven days, and sent the dove out a third time. Noah waited and waited, but this time, she did not return.\n\nA couple weeks later, Noah and his sons worked to remove the covering over the ark. Piece by piece they threw it overboard into the shallow water beneath them. Now they could see in all directions. “Look, the land is dry over there,” Japheth said, pointing south. Now that the cover was gone, the family remained on the top deck, enjoying every little bit of sunlight they could. “The land is dry, so why can’t we leave the ark yet?” Ham asked. “Yahweh told us when to enter and he will tell us when to leave. We must be patient, son,” Noa h answered. So, awaiting the Lord’s direction, they continued to wait on the ark until one night He said to Noah, “Go out from the ark. Everyone can leave, your wife, your sons, and your son’s wives. Bring with you every animal, every bird, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth so they can scatter and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.”\n\nThat morning, 371 days since they entered the ark, Noah opened the door and they went out. Every lion, every lamb, every eagle, every canary, and all the creeping creatures that creep on the ground left the ship and Noah’s family said goodbye to the ark that brought them safely through the water.\n\n**Jesus is the ark that brings us safely through judgment. When we trust in his mercy, we can step into eternal life.**\n \n"

What is your favorite food? \n\nPharaoh had a dream about food, but he didn’t know why. He couldn’t understand what his dream was about and neither could any of his magicians. So, Pharaoh called Joseph out of prison and said to him, “I had a dream. Can you tell me what it means?”\n\nJoseph replied, “If God wants, he will give me understanding of your dream.” Pharoh said, \n“In my dream seven fat cows came out of the river and began to eat some grass. Suddenly, seven thin cows came and ate them up. Then I had another dream. I saw seven good ears of corn on a stalk but then seven bad ones came along and swallowed them up as well. I am very troubled over this dream, but I don’t understand what it means. Can you tell me, Joseph?”\n\nJoseph replied, “God has given me an answer, Pharaoh. The seven cows and the seven ears of corn are seven years. For seven years, Egypt will have lots of food. Rain will come and water the plants so the people and animals will have plenty of food. Then, when the seven years are over, the rain will stop and there will not be any water. The plants will die and there will be no more food to eat. There will be a famine. This will go on for seven years.”\n\n“Oh no!” cried Pharaoh. “What will we do?”\n\n“Don’t worry, God has given me an answer for this too,” said Joseph. “Pick a man who has understanding and knows what to do. He will gather some of the food from the seven years of abundance and save it. When the bad years come and the water dries up, the people can eat the food that has been saved. Then the people will not go hungry.”\n\n“Wow! God has truly spoken through you,” Pharaoh exclaimed.  Joseph, I will take you out of prison and put you in my palace. You will be the one to gather the extra food and store it up for the seven years of famine. Except for me, no one in Egypt will be more important than you.”\n\nJoseph was amazed! God had kept his promise to bless Joseph. He had taken him out of prison and placed him on a throne next to Pharaoh in order to save people from hunger.  \n\t\n\n1. **How did Joseph help Pharaoh?** Joseph helped Pharaoh understand the meaning of his dream. This is called interpretation.\n2. **Pharaoh gave Joseph power over all of Egypt. What was his new job?** Pharaoh told Joseph to save the extra food and store it so the world around him could be saved from hunger during the famine.\n\n**The Lord brought Joseph from a lowly prison to the highest position next to Pharaoh in order to save the world around him. In a similar way, Jesus our Messiah, came to earth as a lowly man in order to save us from our sin. Then God raised him to the highest place in heaven at his right hand.   **  "

When he returned, Pharaoh looked deeply troubled. \n\n“I have had a disturbing dream and I need an interpretation,” Pharaoh explained as the cupbearer dressed him in his royal robes and set his Nemes upon his clean-shaven head, portraying his sovereignty over the people. Adjusting the flaps of the Nemes, the cupbearer reached high above his head, draping the cloth over Pharaoh’s shoulders. “Quickly!” Pharaoh ordered, impatient to meet with his council.\n\nA few of his wise men and magicians were ready and waiting when Pharaoh entered and took a seat on his throne. “I had a dream and I need you to interpret it. I believe it has great significance, for I saw cows and the Nile River, representations of the gods.”\n\n“Your majesty, tell us your dream and we will interpret it,” the lead magician said confidently. \n\n“I was standing beside the Nile and suddenly seven cows, plump and healthy, came up out of the water and began to eat the grass on the shore. Then, seven more cows came out of the water, but they were not healthy, they were ugly and thin. These seven thin cows stood beside the water like the first seven, but they did not eat the grass, instead they began to eat up the seven healthy cows!” Pharaoh explained, looking disturbed. “The dream roused me from my sleep, and I laid awake for hours until I eventually fell asleep again. However, it was not a restful sleep, for I had a second dream. This time, a corn stalk stood before me and growing from it were seven healthy ears of corn. Then I saw seven more ears of corn sprout from the stalk, but these were unhealthy ears, thin, and blighted by the east wind. Suddenly, these thin ears began to swallow up the healthy ears until they were gone.”\n\nEager to stand out, one of wise men came forward and said, “The gods have given me an interpretation, my Lord.”\n\n“You may speak,” Pharaoh said, granting permission.\n\n“Through your dream, I see our future secure. The Nile represents Hapi, the god of the Nile and the cows represent Isis, the goddess of the earth. Hapi will bring fertility to the goddess Isis causing our livestock and grain to increase. Some of the harvest will be bountiful and some less bountiful but nevertheless, it will increase Egypt’s wealth and abundance,” the wise man explained.\n\n“But how do you explain the unhealthy cows swallowing the healthy ones?” Pharaoh asked, but the wise man could give no answer.\n\n“May I speak, your majesty,” asked the lead magician.\n\n“You may,” answered Pharaoh, looking skeptical.\n\nThe magician lifted his amulet from around his neck and said, “I have a spell which, if spoken with this amulet, can ensure the fertility that Hapi brings will be completely bountiful. I can make every cow healthy and every ear of corn bountiful.” \n\nThe magician bowed his head and shuffled back, his arms still outstretched, holding the amulet high. Pharaoh said nothing, looking unconvinced at their interpretation and attempt to shape the future. \n\n“This isn’t good enough!” he shouted in frustration. “I want real answers!”\n\n“Please, your eminence,” one of the wise men said. “Give us time to consult the gods.”\n\n“Fine! Come back to me with a right interpretation!”\n\nThe wise men and magicians left the palace to practice divination attempting to determine the message the gods had given to Pharaoh. When they returned, Pharaoh was eagerly waiting for answers. \n\nSo, the leader of the wise men stepped forward and said, “We have discerned an interpretation, your majesty.”\n\n“Go ahead,” Pharaoh answered impatiently.\n\n“Both of your dreams are a warning to Egypt. Seven deadly illnesses will come and consume our livestock and grain. If we don’t protect ourselves, the illness will consume us as well!” he explained.\n\n“Your highness,” interrupted a magician. “We can use our ivory wands to call upon the gods for your protection. We will draw a circle around the palace and invoke the spirits to keep you from harm.”\n\n“THIS IS NOT AN INTERPRETATION!” Pharaoh shouted, his frustration boiling over. “You have not told me the significance of the cows or the Nile. You have failed me! Get out of my sight!”\n\nThat evening, in a cloud of frustration, Pharaoh brooded at the incompetence of his advisors. As the cupbearer served Pharaoh his wine, he carefully said to him, “Your highness, please forgive me for not mentioning this sooner, but I just remembered some important information that might help the situation.”\n\n“Yes, go on,” Pharaoh mumbled, deep in his thoughts as he sipped his wine. \n\n“Two years ago, when I was in Potiphar’s prison with the chief baker, both of us dreamed on the same night. Our dreams were not the same, but they corresponded to one another. Although, each had its own interpretation.”\n\nAt the mention of dreams, Pharaoh turned to face his servant. The cupbearer quickly looked to the floor and continued speaking,\n\n“The man who served Potiphar in the prison was a young Hebrew. When we told him our dreams, he interpreted each of them. This man’s interpretation was correct, for I was restored to the palace and the baker was hung, exactly how he had interpreted our dreams only three days before it happened!”\n\nPharaoh set down his cup and rose to his feet. “Get me Potiphar! Now!” he commanded. \n\nThe cupbearer hurried from the room in search of the captain of the guard, relieved that in Pharaoh’s desperation to find an interpreter, he had disregarded the fact that he had not told him about Joseph sooner.  \n\nIt was well into the night by the time Potiphar arrived. Pharaoh, impatient to find the Hebrew interpreter said, “Who is this servant of yours who interprets dreams? Why have you not told me about him?”\n\n“Your majesty,” said Potiphar. “I don’t know who you are referring to.”\n\n“My cupbearer tells me you have a Hebrew servant in the prison who interpreted his dream,” Pharaoh explained once more, beginning to get irritated.\n\n“Are you referring to Joseph? I didn’t know the man interpreted dreams. He was once the overseer of my home. He brought me great success,” Potiphar said.\n\n“Why is he serving in your prison then?” Pharaoh asked.\n\n“He cannot be trusted, your majesty. He attacked my wife!”\n\nPharaoh laughed. “Attacked your wife? I don’t believe that for a second. Everyone knows Jamila is a contentious and manipulative woman.”\n\nPublicly shamed by Pharaoh himself, Potiphar’s face reddened.\n\n“Clearly, no one can give me a clear understanding of this man. Bring him to me and we will see if he is able to interpret my dreams.”\n\nThat night Potiphar went to Joseph. He gave him new clothes and told him to shave himself because Pharaoh had called for him. Joseph had no idea what to expect. This could be his chance to get out of prison or it could be bad news. Perhaps he would be accused of another crime. Wide awake, he spent all night carefully preparing himself to go before Pharaoh and reflecting on his years in the prison. His hope had not faded, for he believed what Yahweh had promised would be fulfilled at the right time. Perhaps the time was now.\n\t\n**Why did Pharaoh call for Joseph?** The cupbearer told him he could interpret dreams.\n\n**Can you describe Pharaoh’s dream in your own words?** Seven healthy cows came out of the Nile and were eating grass when seven sickly cows came out of the Nile and ate them up. Then seven healthy ears of corn were swallowed by seven unhealthy ears.\n\n**The ancient Egyptians saw dreams as very significant messages from the gods. Why do you think the Lord chose to speak to Pharaoh in a dream?** Perhaps, it was the means to display the blessings and gifts God had given to Joseph. As the story progresses, we will see the impact this had on the entire world.\n\n**Have you ever had a dream that seemed to be a message from God?** Sometimes our dreams are simply a jumble of thoughts and events from our day, but it is possible that God may speak to us in a dream. The prophet Joel (2:28-32) and the Apostle Peter (Acts 2:17-21) say that in the last days, the Spirit will speak through dreams.\n\n**Day 2 - Genesis 41:15-45**\n\nJoseph stood before Pharaoh, clean shaven from head to toe and looking much more Egyptian than his own Hebrew origin. \n\n“I had a dream and there is no one who can tell me its meaning,” Pharaoh said to Joseph. “I have been told that when you hear a dream, you are able to interpret it.”\n\n“Any answer I am able to give comes from God Almighty. He is the one who will give the interpretation,” Joseph humbly explained, bowing his head before Pharaoh.\n\nJoseph listened carefully as Pharaoh recounted, first the dream of cows along the Nile, and then the ears of corn. Joseph felt the Lord bring clarity and understanding to his heart. Without hesitation, Joseph said, “Pharaoh, the two dreams have one meaning. God has revealed what he is about to do.”\n\n“Yes, I have heard this before. Let us see if you can give the correct interpretation,” Pharaoh said to Joseph.\n\nJoseph continued, “The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years. These two dreams have one meaning. The seven thin and ugly cows and the unhealthy blighted ears of corn represent seven years of famine. Just as I said, God has revealed to you what he is about to do. There will be seven years of abundance in all the land of Egypt, but after that will come seven years of famine. The famine will be so severe, that those seven years of abundance will be quickly consumed, just like the cows and the corn. You had the dream twice; this means that what will happen is fixed. These years of plenty and want will be upon us quickly. It cannot be changed.”\n\nThe room went silent for several minutes as Pharaoh studied Joseph. The confidence and clarity of this Hebrew slave astonished Pharaoh. He saw something different in this man that he did not see in any one of his counselors. Finally, Pharaoh said, “I believe your interpretation is correct. I see the spirit of the gods in you. Now, what wisdom do you possess that can keep Egypt from total starvation?” \n\nJoseph responded humbly, “This is my council; choose a wise man and set him over the land of Egypt. Then appoint overseers throughout the land to assist this wise man. During the seven plentiful years, these overseers should take one fifth of the food. Under your authority, they can take the grain and produce harvested and store it for the cities during the years of famine. This will keep Egypt from perishing during the seven years of famine.”\n\nPharaoh’s eyes brightened and he looked pleased for the first time since he had woken the morning of the dream. “Who is this man? I have never met anyone like him. You clearly have the spirit of this god of yours. Where have you been all this time? I could use a wise man like you. Since God has given you and only you the interpretation and discernment concerning my dream, I will put you over my house.”\n\nAt this, Joseph let out a slight gasp and knelt onto one knee, more in reverence to the Lord who had lifted him out of that pit of a prison than in reverence to Pharaoh. Nevertheless, it was Pharaoh, God was using to raise him up. To Joseph’s astonishment, Pharaoh continued.\n\n“You shall command all my people. Only I, Pharaoh, will have more authority than you. At your own advice, I am placing you over the entire land of Egypt.”\n\nThen Pharaoh arose from his throne and approached Joseph and lifted him to his feet. In Joseph’s mind, it was as if the hands of his Father in heaven were lifting him out of his suffering and exalting him to this place of great honor. Overwhelmed by the steadfast love of Yahweh, Joseph stood as Pharaoh grasped his signet ring on his finger and removed it. When Pharaoh took Joseph’s hand, it took all of Joseph’s strength to keep his tears from spilling onto Pharaoh’s royal robes. Then he gently slid the ring onto Joseph’s own finger.\n\n“Bring garments of fine linen for this man!” he shouted. “Dress him in gold as befits his position.” \n\nWith those words the servants scattered to prepare for their new vizier, while Joseph was taken to his new home in the palace. The next day, Joseph was dressed even more elaborately in the Egyptian attire befitting his station. Then the servants led him outside the palace to where his chariot awaited. Drawn by some of the most magnificent horses he had ever seen, it was difficult for Joseph to grasp the luxury that now surrounded him. Only yesterday, he had been confined to the pit of prison and now he was second in command of all of Egypt. Joseph took his seat behind the driver and waited. Ahead of him awaited another chariot even more opulent than his own. Suddenly, Pharaoh emerged from the palace dressed in his most extravagant garments. With a nod at Joseph, he stepped aboard his chariot, and they took off into the city. Joseph had never been in a chariot. Even his job as overseer to Potiphar had not afforded him this luxury. The horses almost danced in place as the driver managed to restrain their power. Parading through the streets of Memphis, the people bowed their knee as Pharaoh passed and then bowed their knee again to Joseph. Humbled by his unworthiness, Joseph thought back to the day of his brother’s betrayal. He had sat in the bottom of a cistern, heartbroken and wounded over their hatred towards him. Now all of Egypt was bowing before him. This was something he didn’t deserve, yet Yahweh was fulfilling his promise and Joseph was amazed at his faithfulness.\n\nThe next day, Pharaoh met with Joseph and gave him his last set of instructions before leaving the nation in his hands. “Our ride through the capital yesterday demonstrated that your command is equal to mine. No one in all the land of Egypt shall do anything without your consent. Go to the cities throughout the land and present yourself to the people. But before you go, Potiphera, the priest of On has a daughter named, Asenath. I am giving her to you as a wife. Furthermore, I bestow on you a name that is above every name but mine. You shall now be called, Zaphenath-paneah”, which means God speaks and he lives. \n\nJoseph bowed low before Pharaoh and smiled. Yahweh had spoken and he was certainly alive and at work in Egypt. \n\t\n**What was Joseph’s interpretation of Pharaoh’s dream?** Joseph said that both dreams had the same meaning. The healthy cows and the healthy corn represented seven years of abundance in Egypt. The unhealthy cows and unhealthy corn were seven years of famine that would consume the land. The reason for having the dream twice, was that the years of abundance and famine were fixed.\n\n**Joseph gave a wise solution to the seven years of famine. How did Pharaoh respond to this?** Pharaoh took Joseph out of prison and gave him authority over all of Egypt. He was brought to the highest place in Egypt, second only to Pharaoh. \n\n**In Philippians 2:1-11, Paul talks about Jesus as the example of humility. The Father lifted him up from death to a place of great honor and authority. What connections do you see between Joseph and Jesus?** Joseph was a living illustration of the Messiah God had promised in his blessing to Israel. Like Jesus, Joseph was hated by his own brothers, he was put in a place of service, and was falsely accused. Joseph went from a place of humility in prison and exalted to a place of honor and authority in Egypt. This is only a short list of the many ways in which Joseph’s life can point us to Christ.\n\t\n**Day 3 - Genesis 41:46-52**\n\nJoseph’s new position wasn’t all luxury and opulence. The Lord had raised him up for a purpose. He was in the service of the King of Egypt, put there to help protect and guide the people through a great famine. So, Joseph said goodbye to his new wife and set out across the land of Egypt. He traveled by ship down the Nile, towards the Mediterranean, to the port city of Tanis. There, he went in search of the most renowned architect in all of Egypt, a man who had contributed to the work on the pyramids. \n\n“I need you to design a structure to store corn, barley, and wheat. It must be large enough to store more than seven years worth of grain for this city. Is this possible?” he asked the architect. \n\nHonored to be put in the service of someone so powerful, the architect agreed. “It is possible, but only if I have enough laborers to build it.”\n\n“I will make sure they are provided,” Joseph replied. “It needs to be completed as soon as possible. I expect Egypt to bring in three separate harvests this year.”\n\nThen, Joseph got into his chariot and headed to the harbor. There was no question as to his power and position when the merchants saw the gold chain around Joseph’s neck and Pharaoh’s ring on his finger. He quickly found the most successful merchant and appointed him as Tanis’ overseer to buy and sell goods on behalf of Egypt. \n\n“Over the next seven years, you are to trade Egypt’s merchandise for food,” Joseph instructed. “Any grain coming into this port, whether from Egypt or other nations, is to be purchased, and prepared for long term storage. Barter the papyrus, linen, and gold for wheat, corn, or barley. But that is not all. Barter for fish and fruit as well.”\n\n“But, your eminence, how can we store fish and fruit for such a long time? It will spoil,” the merchant asked.\n\n“You are to assign someone to dry it. Once it is dried, it can be stored for many years,” Joseph explained, revealing the wisdom God had given him. “If you are successful in the responsibilities I have given you, you will be rewarded greatly.”\n\nThe merchant bowed and said, “I will be careful to do everything you have asked.”\n\nJoseph went from Tanis to Memphis and to every city in the rich agricultural region of the Nile delta. Just like in Tanis, Joseph appointed men in each city to oversee the purchase and storage of food. When he finally returned to his home in Thebes, Joseph found that Asenath had given birth to a son. At the sight of his firstborn, all the heartache from his brothers was forgotten. He felt the love for his son that he had so desperately longed for. So, he called him Manasseh.\n\nFor seven years, Joseph traveled the land of Egypt to ensure each city was storing the food they needed for the coming famine. In that time, Joseph had a second son. He named him Ephraim because of the fruitfulness the Lord had brought to him in this foreign land where he had experienced so much hardship. Although the fruitfulness was not just evident in Joseph’s life, but in the entire land of Egypt. Year after year, just as Joseph had said, Egypt produced one bountiful crop after another. The storehouses were filling up so fast, that the builders could not build fast enough to store the grain that was being brought in. The Land was experiencing great abundance, just as Joseph had foretold. \n\t\n**What did Joseph do with the abundance God had provided for Egypt?** Joseph had the extra food put in storage until the famine came.\n\n**How was Joseph able to oversee the agricultural economy of the entire nation of Egypt?** The Lord had placed Joseph in the position, so it was him who gave Joseph every bit of wisdom and knowledge he needed to accomplish his will. Joseph did not attribute any of it to himself. He gave all glory to the Lord. \n\n**Through his circumstances, Joseph had been humbled and he remained humble in his exaltation. Have you been humbled in your walk with Christ?** According to Philippians 2:1-11, is this a necessary part of our journey of faith? Paul says that with a mind of humility like Christ, we are to put other’s interests before our own. \n\n \n**Day 4 - Genesis 41:56-57**\n\nWhen the seven years of abundance had ended, the ugly and thin cows emerged from the Nile in the form of drought. The rain stopped and over time the banks of the river began to recede. The farmers could no longer irrigate their crops and ears of corn began to look blighted until the land became so dry that they disappeared altogether. Then, the famine reached the marketplace. There was nothing left for the people to eat. So, at Pharaoh’s command, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold food to the people. The abundance that he had stored up over the previous seven years was rationed and sold. Over time the famine extended to the surrounding nations and word quickly spread that food could be found in Egypt. The dreamer not only saved Egypt from famine, but also the world.  \n\t\n**How did Joseph’s interpretation prove to be true?** At the end of the seven years of abundance, the famine started, proving that everything Joseph had said was true.\n\n**For what purpose did God humble and then exalt Joseph?** To save the people from starvation.\n\n**How far did Joseph’s salvation reach?** Joseph was able to use the food to save people from the whole world from starvation.\n\n**Do you see a foreshadowing of Christ in this?**  Jesus is the Bread of Life who came to save the whole world from their sin. \n\n\n**Joseph was brought from a place of humility and then exalted in order to save the world from famine. He was a foreshadow of Jesus who chose to humble himself to the point of death in order to save the world from their sin. Then his Father in heaven highly exalted him. Humility comes before exaltation.** \n\n\n",

Still, God did not give him the ability to know God's timing or His ultimate plan. Joseph's time in prison passed like a slow, agonizing death. Even though the cupbearer forgot about Joseph, God did not. God was working to prepare the ground for Joseph's rise to leadership.\n\nTo accomplish this, God once again communicated through dreams. The Egyptians believed that royal dreams indicated a special bond between the gods and the king. So, when Pharaoh woke from his vivid dream, he was eager to know its meaning. \nPharaoh's need to understand his dream, coupled with the inability of his wise men to give counsel to interpret the dream, creates the perfect scenario for Joseph to step back into the scene. From the outside looking in, we can see the sovereign hand of God working to prepare the way for his Redeemer.\n\n1. How do Joseph's two years in prison help us understand the sovereignty of God?\n2. How do you see God working to prepare the way for Joseph?\n3. What does Joseph's response to Pharaoh's problem (vs. 15-16) say about Joseph's faith in God?\n\n**Genesis 41:25-36 – God raises up the Redeemer**\n\nWhat all of Pharaoh's wise men and magicians could not do, Joseph did in a matter of seconds. Joseph did not have to first consult with God or do any kind of ceremonious incantation. This would have been a striking difference between Joseph and the men Pharaoh had surrounded himself with. Joseph knew right away that Pharaoh's dream was from God and that it depicted what God was about to do. \n\nNot only does God give Joseph the correct interpretation of Pharaoh's dream, but He also gives Joseph the ability to provide wise counsel. Pharaoh thought his problem was that he had had a dream he could not interpret. Joseph pointed out that the real problem was the impending famine. For the kingdom of Egypt to survive this disaster, specific actions must be taken, and the right people needed to be put in charge. Here we see God faithfully working to raise up his Redeemer to be in the right place and at the right time.\n\n1. What phrase(s) are repeated? Why is this important?\n2. What was the three-point wisdom that Joseph gave to Pharaoh?\n3. What does Pharaoh learn about God? \n\n**Genesis 41: 37-57 – God saves the world through the Redeemer.**\n\nIn order to survive the impending famine, Joseph gives advice that is both logical and urgent. He tells him to find the right person to carry out the right plan. The words Joseph uses are \"discerning and wise.\" For Egypt to survive, Pharaoh needed a leader who understood the situation (discerning) and had the skill and ability (wisdom) to act. After his entire group of advisors fail to interpret the dream, Pharaoh rightly concludes he is left with only one option. Joseph was the only one who understood the meaning of the dream and the only one who had a direct answer as to how Pharaoh should respond to its interpretation. \n\nPharaoh's response not only pointed out Joseph's ability to rule, but he recognized the source of his ability. Pharaoh recognized Joseph's God as having greater power than his own or that of his magicians. This is not to be overlooked. The Egyptians regarded Pharaoh as a divine manifestation in human form.  Pharaoh chose to submit himself under Joseph's God by receiving Joseph's interpretation and counsel. By recognizing the power of Yahweh working in Joseph, Pharaoh lifts Joseph to be the Redeemer of Egypt. \n\n1. Beginning In Canaan, what is the repeated pattern that we see in Joseph's life that God uses to ultimately raise him to power in Egypt?\n2. Now released from prison, what is Joseph's new job description?\n3. Have you ever experienced a time when you received discernment and wisdom from God?\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n**Philippians 2:1-11 – Joseph's humility and ascension to power prefigure God's ultimate Redeemer**\n\nGod orchestrates events and persons throughout the Old Testament to prefigure Jesus the Messiah. Through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, biblical authors recognized these parallels. They wrote so that the reader is able to see and understand God's plan of redemption. Joseph's journey to a prison cell in Egypt, and his subsequent rise to power, are examples. \n\nSome parallels are:\n| OT              |              Situation                         |             NT |\n|-----------| ----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Gen 37:3 | Beloved by their fathers | Matt 3:17 |\n| Gen 37:4, 5, 8 |  Hated by their brothers without cause | John 10:11-14 |\n| Gen 37:20 | Plotted against by their own kinsmen | John 11:53 |\n| Gen 37:23 | Stripped of their robes | John 19:23, 24 |\n| Gen 37:28 | Sold for the price of a slave | Matt 26:15 |\n| Gen 39:7 | Severely tempted | Matt 4:1 |\n| Gen 39:16-18 | Falsely accused | Matt 26:59, 60 |\n|  Gen 40:2, 3 | Placed with two prisoners, one of whom was lost, and the other saved |  Luke 23:32 |\n\n\nHowever, unlike Joseph, Jesus chose to lay aside his glory with the Father, humble himself by becoming a servant, and willfully die on the cross for sinners. God raised Joseph from prison and placed him over Egypt to save the world from famine. Jesus displays greater power by rising from the dead and ascending to heaven. He sits at the Father's right hand and will reign for all eternity over the universe. \n\n1. What other parallels do you see in this passage between Joseph and Jesus?\n2. What does this passage teach us about the importance of humility?\n3. How can you respond in worship to Jesus, who was humbled to the point of death on a cross for your salvation?\n\n$$$$$$$\n",

                        "value": "**A narrative for the young based on the lesson’s text**\n\n*Day 1*\n\nYear after year, Isaac prayed to Yahweh, asking him to give his wife Rebekah a child. Still, year after year, Rebekah showed no signs of pregnancy. Nevertheless, Isaac remained faithful to the Lord, trusting in the promise of becoming a mighty nation one day. Then after nineteen years, the Lord answered. Although she was thrilled to be expecting a baby, Rebekah’s pregnancy was not easy. Day after day, the child rolled and pushed and struggled within her, causing immense pain. One day, she could take it no longer. With tears streaming down her face, she went to Abraham and asked, “What is happening to me? Please, ask the Lord, why my baby is causing me so much pain?” \n\nAbraham stooped over his daughter-in-law as she kneeled at his feet. Then he laid his old and wrinkled hand upon her head and said, “There are two boys in your womb, who will each become his own nation. These two nations will struggle with one another and be divided. One shall be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.”\n\nTwins? I am going to have twins? What a blessing of the Lord, she thought to herself. But what would not escape her were the words, ‘the older will serve the younger.’ Finally, after months of pain, to her relief, Rebekah gave birth to a healthy boy. “He is full of hair!” her nurse said. Rebekah’s nurse was so distracted by the fuzz all over his body, she almost didn’t see the arm of a second baby stretched out and clasped to his heel. “There are two babies, Mistress!” she cried out excitedly. “It’s another boy, and it looks like he was fighting to come out ahead of his brother,” she explained with a chuckle. As the nurse laid the two boys on her breast, Rebekah pondered the oracle from the Lord. Would the struggle between these two boys continue, she wondered? \n\n**Who did Rebekah give birth to?** She gave birth to twin boys. The first was hairy, and the second was holding onto his brother’s heel.\n\n**Rebekah asked the Lord what was happening to her. What was the Lord’s reply?** He told her two nations in her womb were struggling within her. He told her the older boy would serve his younger brother in the future.\n\n* Day 2*\n\nThe struggle between Isaac and Rebekah’s boys continued. The firstborn they named Esau because of his hair, and his younger brother was named Jacob. Although they were twins, Esau and Jacob were drastically different. Not only by their looks but also in personality. Esau spent most of his time in the field as an avid hunter. Isaac adored Esau’s charisma and confidence, but he enjoyed the delicious meat Esau brought home for the family most of all. Blending into the folds of the tent, Jacob watched with envy the attention Isaac gave his eldest son. As much as he desired his brother’s place in the family, he knew he could never be like Esau. So, his timidity and quietness kept him close to his mother, and Rebekah cherished him. \n\nOne late autumn, Esau had gathered a group of men, loaded donkeys, and camels with provisions, and left on his annual hunting trip. Weeks passed, and Esau had still not returned. “Your brother may not come home,” Rebekah said to Jacob. “If a wild animal has killed him, then you will be the one to take his birthright.” \n\n“Yes, mother. You have reminded me of the oracle my whole life that says I am to take the place of the firstborn.” Jacob said with a sigh. “Is he to inherit everything that belongs to Father?” he asked as curiosity took over.\n\n“More than that,” she explained. “Esau is to receive the blessing of the promise that was given to your grandfather Abraham. This is of far greater value than treasures you see around here. At your grandfather’s death, your father will take over as the spiritual leader and priest of our family. Then, when your father, Isaac, passes away, Esau will become a priest according to our customs. This is his birthright. But I know that Yahweh has chosen you, Jacob. Those were his words before you were even born. It’s not based on anything you have done. In his great plan, he has simply chosen you to carry on the blessing. So this might be the opportunity Jacob, if Esau doesn’t return, you will hold the birthright.”\n\nTrue to his character, Jacob kept silent, yet his mind raced with possibilities of what the future might hold. Slightly overshadowed by the fear of losing his brother lay the desire to take his place. He envied the great privilege of carrying on the promised blessings from Yahweh.   \n\nMany more weeks went by as the dry, hot months of autumn became an unusually dry winter. A famine was progressing on the land, and Jacob began to think that his mother might be right. Maybe Esau and his men had been unable to find water and perished in the desert. But his insight proved to be false when a servant blew a horn one evening, announcing their return. Relieved, Jacob quickly headed to the cooking area to thicken the lentil soup that had been cooking all day. The men would be hungry, so he helped his mother prepare as much food as they could.\n\nAs Esau led his hunting party into camp, it was clear that they had very little success. The men looked thin, and only a few of the donkeys carried the game on their backs. Esau was the first to come and recline by the fire, his companions close behind. “Jacob, my little brother, bring me a bowl of that red stew you made. I am hungry and exhausted!” Esau bellowed.\n\nJacob stood over the pot, stirring the lentils and sending a delicious aroma into the air. Without thinking, Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright for this stew, and you can eat as much as you want.”\n\nWithout even flinching, Esau quickly said, “Sure. What use is it to me anyway? I feel like I am about to die. Just bring me the stew.”  \n\nJacob smiled in satisfaction as he watched his brother eat bowl after bowl of soup. Without hesitation, his brother was willing to sell him his birthright for a lousy meal. Things were looking to be in his favor! Surprised to see that the exchange had little effect on his brother, Jacob took Esau’s empty bowl once he finished eating. He watched dumbfounded as Esau meandered his way back to the tent, calling out, “Thank you, my faithful brother!”\n\n**What did Jacob want to take from his brother Esau?** He took his birthright. \n\n**What was Esau’s birthright?** The birthright belonged to the oldest son, which meant that he received twice as much of the inheritance when his father died and the right to become head of the household and the family’s spiritual leader.\n\n**Does serving the Lord hold value to you? What do you value most?** \n\t\n*Day 3*\n\nJacob had not forgotten that Esau had given up his birthright, but he wondered if his father knew. The famine was growing worse, and his grandfather Abraham had recently passed away. So, Isaac had been preoccupied until he announced to everyone, “We will travel to Gerar, to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, and then head south to Egypt. There is not enough food to survive here, and the river has dried up.”  While Jacob helped his mother pack up the food and supplies, Esau prepared the animals for travel. On the road to Gerar, Isaac went out to the field one day to worship Yahweh. Helping to prepare the food for the household, Jacob was with his mother when Isaac returned, bursting into the tent.\n\n“Rebekah!” he called, sounding short of breath. “Yahweh appeared to me when I was praying. He affirmed the blessing he had given to my father. God will bless me and give me all these lands. He said he would multiply our offspring as the stars of heaven. Someday, they will bless all the nations of the earth because my father Abraham obeyed his voice. I knew that I would carry the blessing, but it is so comforting to hear the Lord confirm it himself,” he sighed. “He also told me not to go down to Egypt. So we will continue to Gerar and remain there. But Rebekah, you must tell the king that I am your brother. He will see your beauty, and I am afraid he will kill me so he can take you.”\n\nJacob listened quietly as his mother voiced her concern saying, “Yes, my lord, I will do as you wish, but there must be another way.” Without even a glance at Jacob, Isaac embraced her and said, “I will go tell Esau everything that the Lord has said.” When Isaac had gone, Rebekah said, “Don’t worry, son. One day you will be the one he speaks to about Yahweh’s blessing. You will take his place.”\n\nJacob and his family stayed in Gerar for a long time until the king discovered that his mother was indeed his father’s wife and not his sister. If it had not been for the abundant wealth and blessing Yahweh had bestowed on his father, he would have appeared much more foolish. So, they moved out of Gerar and eventually ending up in Beersheba, where Yahweh appeared to his father once more. Jacob had begun to yearn more and more for the relationship his father had with Yahweh. He watched in awe as Isaac built an altar there at Beersheba, where the Lord had spoken. Settling in there, Jacob saw the promise of Yahweh to bless his father come to pass. There was peace between Isaac and Abimelech, as well as a source of water. As his father’s wealth continued to multiply, everyone surrounding him knew it simply was a blessing of the Lord. Things were good until his brother took not one but two wives from a foreign tribe, and with them came trouble for his parents.\n\t  \n\n**What did God promise to give Isaac?** Because of Isaac’s faith, the Lord promised him land, many children, and great blessing.\n\n**In what way did Isaac fail to trust the Lord when the famine came?** When Isaac traveled to the city where Abimelech reigned, he lied and said Rebekah was his sister to protect himself instead of believing that Yahweh would protect him. \n\n**Have you ever lied to protect yourself? How could you have done a better job trusting in the Lord?**\n\n* Day 4*\n\nThe trouble Esau’s Hittite wives had brought to their household had aged Jacob’s father, Isaac. Esau had not allowed Isaac to find his son a wife like Abraham had done for him. He had gone his own way and chosen his own wives from the nations Yahweh had directed Abraham to stay clear of. Grieved by the path his eldest son had taken, Isaac aged quickly. His eyesight had failed, and his health had become so poor, he remained in his bed most days until he was on the verge of death.\n\n“Send for my son,” he called to the servant. \n\nWhen Rebekah heard that Isaac had sent for Esau, she found a place near the tent where she could conveniently listen to her husband’s words to Isaac. She knew as well as Isaac that his days seemed numbered, so she expected him to give his blessing soon. \n\n“I am here, father,” Esau said, entering his father’s tent.\n\n“My health is failing, and I am old. I do not know the day of my death, but it must be approaching quickly. So, take your weapons, your quiver, and bow and go hunt some game for me. A delicious meal made from the food I love is the only thing I desire before I die. Bring it to me and so that I may pass on the blessing to you before I die. \n\nEsau had barely exited his father’s tent before Rebekah was on the move. Her robes flying behind her, Rebekah went from tent to tent looking for Jacob. Finally, she caught sight of him by the well. “Jacob!” She called out. “It’s time,” she told him, trying to catch her breath. \n“Time for what, mother?”\n“Time to receive your father’s blessing. He just sent your brother out to hunt some game and prepare a meal for him. He is planning to bless your brother, Esau, before he dies. So now is your chance to take his place. Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats. From those, I will prepare something delicious for your father, a meal that he loves. Then, if you serve it to him before Esau returns, he will give you the blessing instead of Esau. Remember, Yahweh chose you, not your older brother, and he sold you his birthright, so you should receive the inheritance from your father. \n\n“I desperately want the blessing, Mother. But if the Lord chose me to carry it, why did he make me this way? I am weak in Father’s eyes, and I lack the confidence that Esau has. I don’t know if I am worthy of having it.”\n\n“Jacob, the Lord has chosen you. He is our maker. He has mercy on whom he has mercy and chooses whom he wishes for his own purposes. Look at me. I was simply chosen to be your father’s wife because I offered some camels a drink of water,” she said with a chuckle. “Who are we to question the ways of Yahweh? What I do know is that he has chosen you over your brother, so we must not let Esau get the blessing.”\n\n“But what if I bring the food to Father and recognizes that it’s me? Even though he is blind, Esau is really hairy, and I am not, and perhaps he will want to touch me? If he finds out I am not Esau, he might curse me for tricking him.” Jacob said.\n\n“If that happens, let the curse be on me, son. Now, just obey my voice and go quickly and bring me the goats,” Rebekah instructed.\n\nJacob followed his mother’s instructions and brought the goats. He watched as she skinned them and then cut up the meat. As the meal cooked over the fire, Rebekah took the fresh skins, cut some smaller pieces, and set them aside. \n\n“What are those for?” Jacob asked.\n\n“I will show you,” she said. “First, go into my tent, and you will find your brother’s best robes. Put them on.” Rebekah took the fresh goat skins and laid them on Jacob’s hands and neck when he was dressed. “There,” she announced. “You are hairy like your brother.”\n\nJacob smirked as his mother handed him the meal and bread she had prepared. “Now go and take what belongs to you.”\n\nJacob hesitantly stepped into his father’s tent. Clearing his throat, he called to his father. “I am here,” he replied. “Are you my son?”\n\n“I am Esau, your firstborn. I brought you a meal, just as you told me,” the lie came more effortless to Jacob than he expected. Gaining confidence, he approached his father. “Now sit up and eat of my game, so you can bless me.”\n\nIsaac lifted his head and pushed himself up from his bed until he was sitting. “How did you find and kill this game so quickly?” he asked, puzzled.\n\n“The Lord gave me great success as I went into the field. I was able to find some game right away.”Jacob began to feel the guilt of lying to his father but was excited that it seemed to be working. \n\nIsaac continued to look puzzled and a bit skeptical. “Please, come close to me. I want to feel if you are really my son Esau.” \n\nJacob’s heart began to pound. His father wasn’t buying this disguise, he thought. He is going to feel these goat skins and know the truth. Feeling stuck with no other options, Jacob stuck his arm out to his father. Isaac gently rubbed Jacob’s wrist and mumbled to himself, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are Esau’s hands.” Then he raised his voice and asked, “Are you really my son, Esau?”\n\n“I am,” Jacob replied. \n\n“Bring me that game to eat, and I will bless you,” Isaac said. \n\nSo, Jacob served his father the food his mother had prepared and gave him some wine to drink. \n\n“Come near and kiss me, my son,” Isaac asked, still unconvinced. As Jacob came close, his father breathed deep, smelling the outdoors on Esau’s cloak. Finally, to his relief, his father looked persuaded.\n\n“The smell of my son!” Isaac said as he began to bless Jacob. “May God bless you in the land, and may you triumph over your enemies. May he bless those who bless you, and may he curse those who curse you.”\n\nWhen he finished, Jacob swiftly moved out of the tent for fear of his brother’s return. When Esau came back from hunting with his game and began preparing a meal, he had barely escaped being seen. Entering his father’s tent, Esau said, “Here is your game, Father. Just as you asked.  Now, sit and eat so you may bless me.”\n\nIsaac looked confused and asked, “Who are you?”\n\n“I am Esau, your firstborn son.”\n\nIsaac began to tremble and shake. His face turned red, and through gritted teeth, he asked, “Who was it then who came in earlier with the food for me to eat? I ate all of it and blessed him.”\n\n“WHAT?!?” Esau cried out angrily. “You must bless me as well, Father!” \n\n“It was your brother who came in here deceitfully and took your blessing from you.” Isaac declared.\n\n“He has cheated me twice now! Once for my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing!” Esau continued on. “Is there any blessing left for me?” he pleaded with his father.\n\n“I have made him lord over you, and the land will provide for all of his needs,” Isaac explained with regret. “What else can I do for you?”\n\n“Don’t you have even one blessing left for me, Father? Please! Bless me!” Esau pleaded as he fell to his knees and wept. \n\nThen Isaac spoke and said, “You will dwell in a desolate place. Your brother will be your master until you break from his hold on you.” \n\nDefeated, Esau left his father’s tent and stewed over what his brother had done to him. As his anger developed into bitterness, resentment, and deep hatred, a plan took shape. “When my father passes away, I will kill my brother Jacob,” he said to himself.\n\nEventually, Rebekah discovered Esau’s plans and took action. “Jacob,” she said. “Your brother wants to kill you! The best thing to do is flee to my brother Laban up in Haran. You can stay with him for a while until your brother’s anger dies down. But first I must speak with your father. You cannot go without his blessing.”\n\nSo, Rebekah went to Isaac and said, “Esau’s Hittite wives have caused us so much trouble. We can’t let Jacob marry one as well. He needs a wife, but please don’t let it be from one of the Canaanite tribes. Send him back to my family; maybe he will find a wife there.” Rebekah asked hopefully. \n\t\n\n**What did Jacob trick his father into giving him?** Jacob deceived his father into giving him the blessing that traditionally should have gone to his brother Esau because he was the oldest.\n\n**What was the blessing that Jacob stole?** Traditionally the father pronounced happiness and welfare on the oldest son. In this particular case, Isaac passed down the blessing that he and his father Abraham had received from the Lord. \n\n**Why did God choose Jacob to carry on the blessing and not Esau?** Romans 9 says that God chose Jacob simply because he is the one who decides who he has mercy on. When God chooses someone to follow him, it’s not because we did something to earn it. It’s just simply because he decided to.\n\n* Day 5*\n\t \nIsaac considered what Rebekah had told him, and so he called for Jacob. “If you are to carry on the blessing of Yahweh, you must not take a wife from the Canaanite women,” Isaac explained.  He had come to realize that his preference for his eldest son Esau was outside of the Lord’s will. With this change of heart, Isaac had softened towards his younger son. “I want you to go to Paddan-aran, where your grandfather lives, and take a wife from the daughters of your uncle Laban.”\n\n“Yes, Father,” Jacob said. Then he bowed his head as Isaac blessed him once more.\n\n“May God Almighty, El Shaddai, bless you and give you many children. May he give you and your children the blessing he gave to Abraham so that you may possess the land he promised. “\n\n“Thank you, Father. I will do as you say and go north to Haran,” Jacob answered. \n\nSo, Jacob left Beersheba and began the long journey to Haran. Not long after he passed through the city of Salem, Jacob looked for a place to rest for the night as the sun began to set. Finding a smooth stone, he lay on the hard ground and placed his head upon it. Exhausted from traveling, Jacob fell fast asleep. That night he dreamed of a ladder that connected the earth he laid upon to heaven. There were angels of God going up and down upon it. As he watched them, the Lord stood beside him and said, “I am the Lord, the God of Abraham, your grandfather, and the God of Isaac. This land you are resting upon, I will give to your children. Your children will be so many, they will be like the dust of the earth, and they will be blessed. I am with you, Jacob. I will protect you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”\n\nThen Jacob awoke. “Yahweh is here, and I didn’t even know it,” he said aloud. He looked above him to where he had only moments ago seen a ladder. Only stars remained, and Jacob shivered. The night remained, and the stars twinkled above him. A chill ran through his spine as he realized how awesome this place was. “This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven,” he called out.\n\nEarly the next morning, Jacob took the stone he had rested his head upon and added others to it until it became a pillar. Then he poured oil on it and called the name of the place, Bethel. Jacob stood beside the pillar and made a vow. “If God does everything he has promised me. If he goes with me, protects me, and provides for me so I can return to my father’s house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God, and this pillar of stones shall be God’s house. And of all that you give me, Lord, I will give ten percent of it to you.” \n\n**What did Jacob see in his dream?** Jacob saw a ladder that connected heaven and earth with angels going up and down.\n\n**How did Jacob respond after hearing God’s promise to him?** Jacob wanted to remember that the Lord was here in that place, so he made a pillar of stones. He also vowed to give him ten percent of whatever the Lord gave to him.\n\n**What is your response to the Lord, knowing that he chose you to be a part of his eternal kingdom?**\n\n**The Lord chooses who he wants when he wants, and how he wants. He is our sovereign God, and because he is good, merciful, and gracious, we can rest in his will.**",

The text tells us that Isaac favored his eldest son, and from the way things are written, Rebekah favored Jacob. As we look at every person in this story and observe their actions, we can clearly see that not one individual is innocent of wrongdoing. Every person in this narrative is acting out of their own desires and not in faith. No doubt, Rebekah is operating out of her belief in the oracle she received from the Lord concerning Jacob. Still, she manipulated the situation to ensure the word of the Lord would come to pass. Jacob knew that lying to his father was wrong and grasped the potential consequences as well, but was still willing to go through with it to ensure the blessing would be given to him instead of his brother. From our first introduction, we were made aware of his ability to cheat and scheme when he tricked his brother into selling him his birthright. Even Isaac, old, sick, and blind, was not an innocent victim in this narrative. His favoritism of Esau and desire to bless him instead of Jacob was evidence of his selfish desires and lack of faith in the promises of God. God was working to fulfill his promise despite every person’s selfishness, pride, or deceitful attitude. The fact that Jacob and Rebekah pulled off their scheme is not proof of God’s approval, it only points out their lack of faith in him to fulfill what he has promised. This story reminds us once again that, despite one’s lack of confidence in the Lord, He will do what he intends to do and fulfill what he plans to accomplish.\n \n1. What does this passage show us about Esau’s character?\n2. What are the differences between the two blessings Isaac gave to his two sons?\n3. Although by no means guiltless, what does this passage show us about Isaac’s faith in God?\n\n\n**Genesis 27:30–46 – God’s promises are irrevocable.**\n\nUpon first glance, we might conclude that Esau was the innocent victim in this story. We need to remember that Esau has already shown what is most important to him, and it is not the things of God. At the end of chapter twenty-five, there is a short but essential story in understanding the heart of Esau. The whole story might seem ridiculous to us. Why would Esau give up his birthright for a bowl of soup? From our perspective, this does not seem like an excellent deal, but nonetheless, Esau agrees to it. This story is not highlighting the quality of Jacob’s soup but the hardness of Esau’s heart. The story ends with, “Thus Esau despised his birthright.” So, it is interesting to see his reaction when he discovers Jacob has tricked his father into giving his blessing away as well. Why despise the birthright but desire the blessing? To answer this question, it is essential to know the difference between the two. As the eldest son, Esau was granted the birthright. This involved; headship of the family, family priesthood, a double portion of wealth, and designation of the one who would be the channel of the covenant. From what we read about Esau, he had no interest in at least 3 out of 4 of these. His lifestyle was more about hunting, waring, and working than being the community and spiritual leader. In this time and place, the blessing was seen as a kind of last will and testament. A blessing could be given to anyone regardless of birth order. Still, the more significant blessing was usually given to the oldest in the family. The other important rule of blessing is that it could not be revoked. Once the blessing was proclaimed, it was binding. This reflected the greater truth that what God declared could not be revoked.\n\n1. What does this passage show us about Esau’s character?\n2. What are the differences between the two blessings Isaac gave to his two sons?\n3. Although by no means guiltless, what does this passage show us about Isaac’s faith in God?\n\n**Genesis 28 – God reminds us of his promises when we need to hear them most.**\n\nFearing for his life, Jacob has to suffer the consequences of his deceit and flee from the wrath of Esau. It seems Rebekah is the clever one in the family. Instead of sending Jacob away in secret, thus risking his inheritance, he tells her husband to send him away to find a wife from among their family. This would serve a purpose since Esau’s wives had caused nothing but turmoil in their family. So, Jacob is on the run. He is no longer in the land of promise. This seems to be the perfect time for God to give him a dream to encourage him and confirm the blessings that he received from his father, Isaac. The purpose of the dream was to strengthen Jacob’s faith in God. The picture of the angels ascending and descending this stairway or ladder into heaven was meant to encourage this frightened and weary traveler. The angelic messengers were busy carrying out the will of God. God was confirming that Jacob’s forced and speedy departure from Canaan would not nullify the promises of God. God promised to keep him safe and to bring him back to the land of his father. In response, Jacob wakes up and uses the stone he was sleeping on as a pillar. As strange as this sounds, his actions were a common practice. It was important for Jacob to mark and rename the place where he encountered God. In response to God’s promises, Jacob vows allegiance to Yahweh. Jacob renames this city Bethel, “House of God.”\n \n1. What are the specific things that God promises Jacob in the dream?\n2. How does Jacob’s response show evidence of his faith?\n3. When was the last time God’s word encouraged or strengthened you when you needed it?\n\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n\n**Romans 9:1–10:4 – What God wills he fulfills.**\n\nIt is said that a woman once said to the late Charles Spurgeon, “I cannot understand why God would say that he hated Esau.” To which Spurgeon replied, “That is not my difficulty, madam. My trouble is to understand why God would love Jacob.”\n\nIn this passage of scripture, Paul uses Old Testament history to teach about God’s sovereign plan of redemption. It is essential to see that Jacob was not a good man. He was a sinner. He was a liar and a deceiver. Although Jacob demonstrated more faith in God, he was not chosen because of his faith. Jacob became a less admirable person in some respects than Esau, which shows that God’s choice was not due to Jacob’s goodness, but God’s will. Jacob was chosen instead of Esau to show that no one can assume the blessings of God because of family heritage or birthright. In the words of N.T. Wright, “It’s about grace, not race.” Paul is doubling down on this critical point; salvation is dependent on the mercy of God, not our good works. There are hard verses in this passage that can be difficult to come to grips with. Paul uses the contrast of love and hate; not to depict God’s feelings toward Jacob and Esau but his actions toward one brother and not the other. God’s action was to bestow the blessing of the covenant on the younger brother. Therefore, he rejected Esau, who was the assumed heir because of birth order. Paul reveals that beginning with patriarchs, God’s sovereign will means he chooses who he wants, when he wants, and how he wants to fulfill his plan of redemption.\n \n\n1. What false assumption about the nation of Israel was Paul correcting?\n2. According to Paul, what was the primary reason God chose Jacob and not Esau?\n3. What characteristics or attributes of God are highlighted in this passage?\n\n$$$$$$$\n\n",

However, it is equally essential to the story of God's redemption. It comes on the heels of the sad story of Sarah's death and acts as the transition that shifts from Abraham to his son Isaac. This story is long and repetitious, which marks its importance in the greater narrative of God's promises to Abraham. God was at work to choose the line of succession and heirs of the promise. To allow Isaac to select a wife from among the Canaanites would be to hand the promised land back to the very people God was taking it from within one or two generations. Each of the main characters in this story demonstrates faith and each of them act according to God's promise to Abraham of land, seed, and blessing. Abraham makes his servant (Eliezer) swear a solemn oath to find a wife for Isaac in Mesopotamia, who will become the family's new matriarch after the death of his wife, Sarah. The servant acts in faith by relying on God's faithfulness to prosper his journey and God's providence to guide him. Rebekah acts in faith by returning to Canaan after hearing the servant's story of God's provision. The final scene tells of Isaac meditating at Beer-lahai-roi, which was the place where God had answered prayer once before (16:14). The fact that the servant arrives with Rebekah while Isaac is praying demonstrates Isaac's faith in God's provision to find his bride.\n\n1. What are the characteristics of God that are highlighted in this story?  \n2. How does this story depict Abraham's servant, Eliezer? \n3. Which parts of the story are repeated in the chapter, and what is it emphasizing?\n\n**Genesis 25– God's faithfulness in the past can be counted on in the present and the future.**\n\nThe end of Abraham's life and the explanation of his lineage is a testimony of God's unfailing faithfulness to fulfill his promises. The writer, Moses, also makes two things clear. First, Abraham lived a long time and had a lot more children. Abraham was generous towards all of his children, fulfilling God's promise in an immediate sense. The insertion of the line and life of Ishmael would be the final testimony to this fact. God fulfills his promise to bless those whom he has promised to bless. Secondly, Isaac is the heir of the promise. All of Abraham's children were sent out of his home just like his eldest son, making it very clear that the heir of the promise would come through the one God chose. This theme of God's provision and timing would continue with Isaac as the next part of the story begins with Rebekah, God's chosen wife for Isaac, being barren for 20 years. In fact, within the short span of this chapter, Moses reveals that Isaac's entire life was repetitious of his father, Abraham. The rest of the chapter reminds the reader that God would choose and provide the heir of his promises. The oracle God spoke to Rebekah, the birth of Isaac's twin sons, and the clear contrast between the two boys teaches us of a single point. God is working to fulfill his promises in his time and in his way. \n\n1. What promises did God fulfill in Abraham's lifetime? \n2. Why do you think the story of Jacob and Esau's birth follows Abraham's death when it is clear from the timeline that they were born 15 years before Abraham's death? \n3. After reflecting upon the legacy of Abraham, what do you hope your legacy will be?\n\n**Genesis 26 – God transfers the fullness of his promises, but every generation must choose to walk by faith.**\n\nThis chapter begins with a familiar problem, a familiar sin, and a familiar promise. In response to the famine, Isaac must have had the same inclination his father had when faced with a similar problem. However, God tells Isaac not to go to Egypt but to remain in the land and trust God. Although there are parallels in the life of Abraham and Isaac, God deals with them individually. Isaac was born into wealth, and after his father's death, he became the heir of everything with which God has blessed Abraham. God handed down every animal, every servant, every piece of silver and gold to Isaac. This inheritance was the testimony of God's faithfulness and steadfast love. However, in light of this, God commands him to remain faithful. In return, Isaac would carry on the inheritance of land, seed, and blessing. It is interesting to see how quickly the other characters in this narrative overshadow Isaac. Already living in the shadow of his father, the story of God's redemptive plan almost skips over the history of Isaac.  After Isaac has children, the sneaky work of Jacob and Isaac's clever and masterful wife, Rebekah overshadow this patriarch, leaving his life almost dull, uneventful, and obscure. However, although much of his life is undocumented, the point of his story is not lost. God offers the fullness of the promises he gave to Abraham. However, every generation must demonstrate individual faith, which must develop and mature over time as they walk with God. Although Isaac was the child of promise, he also needed to learn to trust and obey just like his father, Abraham. One other reason the story passes so quickly over Isaac may be to ensure that the focus remains on God and not on those through whom he works to fulfill his promises.\n\n1. What observations are you making about this text? Write down what stands out to you \n2. How does God prove his steadfast love and faithfulness to Isaac? \n3. What differences do you see between the promises God made to Isaac compared the promises God made to his father, Abraham?\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n**Romans 4:13-5:5 – Today, the promise of God's inheritance still comes through faith**\n\nThe story of Abraham and Isaac clearly speak that the promises of God were given to these patriarchs by faith. This theme of receiving God's promises by faith continues for God's children even today. This teaching is the main point that the Apostle Paul stresses in his letter to the first-century church in Rome. Paul was combating the false teaching of the Jews that one needed to keep the law (do everything right) to be a child of the promise. The problem with this teaching, Paul says, is two-fold. First, law-keeping as a condition for receiving God's promises would make faith irrelevant. If this were true, then the story of Abraham has no merit for us today. Secondly, Paul points out that if salvation comes through works of the law, God's promises are worthless. If people need to earn the blessings of God, then there is no need for God to make promises. The blessings of God would no longer be a gift of God, and we would only receive what we can achieve by our merit. \n Paul wants the church to understand that we receive all of God’s promises by faith alone apart from works. Faith means we put our trust entirely in the character of God, who presents himself as a holy, benevolent, loving, promise-keeping God. However, there is also an essential lesson about the nature of faith that Paul wants us to understand.  The moment we believe, we become heirs of all of God's promises just like Isaac, but we do not receive a full and mature faith the moment we believe. Full and mature faith comes to us through the process of sanctification as we walk with God in the power of his Spirit, trusting in his power to make us into the people he has called us to be. \n\n1. According to the text, why is it so crucial that the promise God made to Abraham was dependent on his faith and not works of the law? \n2. What was the conviction that Abraham had that made his faith so strong? \n3. Was there a time in your life when your faith was matured through suffering?\n \n$$$$$$$\n",

Do you remember how he blessed Abraham? God favored Abraham by giving him many gifts that blessed him. But Abraham was growing old, so he gave all the blessings the Lord had promised him over to his son Isaac. But Isaac still did not have a wife. So, Abraham sent his servant on a long journey to find one. When the servant stopped at a well to water his camels, he said to the Lord, “If one of these women give my camels and me a drink of water, I will know that you have picked her to be Isaac’s wife.”\n\nThe Lord answered right away. The first woman to come to the well offered the servant a drink and then watered all of his camels. Her name was Rebekah. She agreed to go with the servant back to Isaac’s home to be his wife. When Isaac saw her riding towards him on her camel, he ran to her and fell in love.\n\nSoon after, Isaac and Rebekah were married, but Rebekah was unable to have a baby. So, Isaac prayed to the Lord and asked him to give them a child. Twenty years later, the Lord answered his prayer by giving them not one but two babies. Rebekah was pregnant with twin boys!\n\nThese boys were very different from one another. The older child was red and very hairy, who would grow up to be a good hunter. His name was Esau. His younger brother was quiet and stayed near the tents close to his mother, Rebekah. His name was Jacob. \n\nWhen Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from hunting and said, “Let me eat some of that stew. I am so very hungry and tired.”\n\nJacob held out a bowl of stew and said to him, “I will give you this stew, but you must give me something in return. Give to me all the blessings that our father Isaac will give you.”\n\n“Sure, you can have it. I am so hungry I might die. What good is my father’s blessing to me?” Esau said.\n\nSo Esau traded his very precious blessing for a bowl of stew that day.\n\t \n1. What did the Lord promise to give Abraham? The Lord promised him land, children, and blessing. Abraham passed this to his son Isaac so he could pass it to his son.\n2. What would you trade for a blessing from the Lord?

I need you to find a wife for Isaac.”\n\n“Yes, Master,” he said. “Where should I look?”\n\n“Promise me you will not find a wife from the daughters of the Canaanites who live here around us. The Lord has given this land to my children and me. We would be giving it right back to the Canaanites through Isaac’s children if he were to marry one of their women,” Abraham explained. “Go back to the country I come from and find a wife for my son there. I have heard that my brother’s wife, Milcah, has given him many children. Perhaps there are daughters among them to choose from.”\n\nEliezer looked troubled, “But Sir, we live so far from there. What if the woman I find is unwilling to follow me back here to the land of Canaan?”\n\n“If you arrive there and there is not a woman that will go with you, you may return and be free from this promise. Just see to it that you do not bring Isaac back there with you. Yahweh, the God of heaven, took me from that land and all my family. He swore to give this land in Canaan to my children and me, so Isaac must remain here! Don’t be concerned, I know you will find a wife there. The Lord will send his angel ahead of you to prepare the way,” Abraham encouraged him.\n\n1. **Who was Abraham’s servant sent to find?** He was sent by Abraham to find a wife for Isaac.\n2. **Why was it so crucial for Isaac to find a wife?** For Isaac to pass on the Lord’s blessing to his own children, he needed a wife.\n\n*Day 2*\n\nEliezer made his promise to do all that Abraham had instructed and departed with ten camels loaded with precious gifts from Abraham. He traveled north, leaving the land of Canaan behind, soon after passing through his own home of Damascus. After many days of travel, Eliezar came to the land of Mesopotamia. There, he stopped outside the city of Nahor, which was the name of Abraham’s brother. As the sun dipped behind the dusty horizon, Eliezer made his camels kneel near a well to rest. He had also chosen to sit near the well to discover the will of Yahweh. As he waited by the well, he lifted up his head and prayed.\n\n“Oh Lord, God of my master Abraham, please show him love by directing me to the wife you have chosen for Isaac. Give me success in my service towards him as I sit here by the well and see many young women draw water for their families. When I ask one of them for a drink, please let her reply be ‘Drink, and I will water your camels as well’ – then I will know you have chosen her to be your Isaac’s wife.” Eliezer’s words faded away as he caught sight of a young girl approaching. Her beauty reminded him of his Master Abraham’s wife, Sarah. He watched her as she clutched a water jar, balanced atop her shoulder. Her eyes twinkled beneath her dark hair as she patiently let the water flow into her jar. With ease, she lifted the jar back to her shoulder and turned back towards the city. Just as she was about to leave, she caught sight of Eliezar walking toward her. She swiftly covered her face with her veil as Eliezer greeted her. \n\n“Please give me a little water to drink from your jar,” he asked. \n\nShe quickly relaxed, seeing from his clothes and the large group with him that he was someone of great importance. She graciously passed him the water saying, “Drink, my lord.” While he drank, the young woman looked over at his camels kneeling nearby and said, “I will draw water for your camels also until they have had enough to drink.”\n\nAt these words, a great smile formed on Eliezer’s face. The young woman looked a little perplexed at his overly joyous response. Nevertheless, she took the jar, poured the water into the trough, and went back to the well to refill it. Eliezer gazed intently at her as she so graciously and patiently watered his camels until the animals were satisfied.! When she had finished watering the camels, Eliezer took a gold ring and two gold bracelets from his satchel. He offered the gifts to the girl and asked her, what is your name?”  \n\nAs she stared in surprise at the beautiful gifts, she said, “I am Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah and Nahor.”\nWhen Eliezer heard the name of Abraham’s brother, his assurance was complete. \n\n1. **Where did Eliezer meet Rebekah?** Eliezer met Rebekah by a well.\n2. **What set Rebekah apart from the other women?** She was willing to serve Eliezer and his camels. Camels can drink a lot of water! \n3. **How do you show kindness and service toward others?**\n\t\n*Day 3*\n\nEliezer said, “You are the one I have been looking for! The Lord Yahweh has surely shown great love to my master!” he said excitedly. “Is there room in your father’s house for my men and me to spend the night?”\n\n“Yes,” she said, nodding. “We have plenty of both straw and food for the animals and lots of room to sleep.”\n\nEliezer bowed his head and worshipped the Lord, saying, “Blessed be the Lord who has shown steadfast love and faithfulness to my master, Abraham. He has led me straight to the house of his brother!”\n\n“I will go tell my family you are coming,” Rebekah said. She took off running towards the city, leaving her water jar behind. When she got to her mother’s house, her brother Laban spotted the gold she was wearing and listened eagerly to how she obtained such beautiful treasures. Then he ran out of the house and down the road to the well, searching for Eliezer. When he found him with his camels, he said, “Come, you who are blessed of the Lord. Why are you waiting out here? I have prepared the house and a place for your animals. Come with me.\nSo, Eliezer followed Laban, and after the camels were fed, they invited him in for supper. \nAs they all sat down together to eat, Eliezer said, “I will not eat until I have said what I have come here to say.” There was an awkward moment of silence as the family saw the mixture of seriousness and excitement across Eliezer’s face. Laban laid his piece of bread down and said, “Okay, we are listening. go ahead and speak.”\n\n“I am the servant of your kinsman Abraham, and I can tell you that Yahweh has greatly blessed him. He has become a great man with flocks of sheep, herds of goats, much silver and gold, servants, camels, and donkeys. Sarah, his wife, bore him a son named Isaac when she was very old. Now to Isaac, Abraham has given all that he has. Thus, my master instructed me to find a wife for his son Isaac. I was not to find one from among the Canaanites but from his own people. When I came to the well, the Lord brought Rebekah to me. I was overjoyed when I learned that her grandfather is my master’s brother. She is the one who God sent me to find!  So now I ask, will you allow your daughter to marry the son of my master? Tell me plainly, so I can go on my way if the answer is no.”\n\n1. **What did Eliezer give to Rebekah?** Eliezer gave Rebekah a gold bracelet and a gold ring for her nose.\n2. **Why was Eliezer so confident that Rebekah was the woman the Lord had led him to?** First, the Lord answered his prayer when she offered to water his camels. Second, she was part of Abraham’s extended family. \n3. **What are some of your prayers that God has answered?** Do you remember to thank him?\n\n*Day 4*\n\nAfter hearing Eliezer’s story of his journey and purpose for coming, Rebekah’s father, Bethuel, answered him, saying, “It is clear this is from the Lord….”\n\nThen Laban spoke up, interrupting his father, saying, “How can we say yes or no when it’s so clear that the Lord has spoken. Take her with you and go. Let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the Lord has said.”\n\nImmediately, Eliezer bowed himself to the earth before the Lord in worship. Then he stood and said to the men with him, “Bring the gifts!” They brought out clothing and jewelry of silver and gold for Rebekah. Then valuable ornaments for her mother and her brother. When he had finished showering them with the gifts from his master, Eliezer sat, and they all celebrated together until late in the evening.\n\nThe following day Eliezer was eager to return to Abraham. Still, Rebekah’s mother was not ready to let her go so quickly. “Let her stay just ten more days, then you can go,” she pleaded. \n\nKindly, but firmly Eliezer replied, “The Lord has been with me, giving me success all this way, do not delay me now.” \n\nWhen asked what she wanted to do, Rebekah agreed with Eliezer, telling her mother that she would go with him. So, Rebekah and her female servants mounted the camels and left her home behind as she began her journey to the Land of Canaan. Waving goodbye, her brother Laban called out a blessing to her, “Our sister, may your children multiply greatly! And may they triumph over their enemies!”\n\n1. **What did Rebekah’s father and brother say to Eliezer? Was she allowed to marry Isaac?** Yes, her father and brother gave her permission to marry Isaac.\n2. **Rebekah was ready to leave her family immediately and go with Eliezer. What does this say about her faith?** Her willingness to follow the Lord’s will and go so far from her family shows her courage and faith in trusting that God’s plans for her would be good. \n3. **When have you been courageous to follow the will of the Lord?**\n\n\n*Day 5*\n\nMany days later, back in the Land of Promise, Isaac was sitting in the field praying. The spot where he sat had become a place of solitude where he could grieve the death of his mother. Isaac found great peace and comfort as he daily came to this place to watch the sunset. As he sat on the matted grass, he relaxed under a tree. As Isaac sat listening to the wind rush through the grass, he caught sight of a group of camels in the distance. “Could it be Eliezer?” he wondered. Isaac rose and headed out to meet them, quickening his pace when it was clear that it was indeed his father’s faithful servant. He became even more enthusiastic when he noticed there was a new group of women traveling with them.  \n\nAs the group of travelers drew near to Abraham’’s home, Rebekah asked Eliezer, “Who is that man walking towards us?”. As the man walked closer, his eyes met hers, and she stared for a moment before catching herself. She quickly looked away and covered her face with her veil.\n\n“He is my master,” Eliezer replied. Rebekah blushed beneath the veil, unsure of how to respond. \n\nWhen Isaac had reached them, the servant dismounted from his camel and explained how the Lord had directed his way to Rebekah. Isaac listened intently, unable to conceal the look of joy on his face. He looked over at Rebekah, perched on her camel. Her eyes sparkled in the setting sun, and Isaac was immediately captivated. Her eyes revealed her beauty that her veil attempted to conceal. \n\nIsaac was finally able to pull himself away from her gaze to say, “Come, let us return to the tents to rest and eat. There will be a feast to celebrate our marriage!” Then he took Rebekah to his mother’s tent and said, “This tent belongs to you now. I will inherit all of Yahweh’s blessings from my father. As my wife, God has chosen you to share in these blessings as my mother shared them with my father.”\n\nIsaac loved Rebekah. Her self-confidence and fiery spirit were just what he needed to pull him out of the grief he carried after the death of his mother. Over the years, Rebekah was not able to have children. Still, Isaac remembered how God provided him with this remarkable woman and how the Lord had worked in his parent’s lives as well. Despite not having children, Isaac continued to believe in the promises of God.   \n\n1. **Was Isaac pleased with the woman Eliezer had found for him?** Yes, Isaac loved Rebekah. They have married right away.\n2. **What does Issac’s happiness with Rebekah show us about the Lord’s goodness towards us?** Isaac needed a wife, but the Lord didn’t just provide Isaac with what he needed. He blessed him with a woman he loved as well.\n3. **Do you believe that God’s promises and commands are meant to bless you?**\n\n\t \nThe blessings that belonged to Abraham were passed to his son Isaac because of his faith. When we believe in God like **Abraham and Isaac, we can share the blessings of being a part of his family.**\n"

It means to trick someone into believing something that is not true. Just like when Jacob tricked his father into believing that he was his brother Esau in order to get his father’s inheritance. In a similar way Jacob is going to be tricked more than once by his uncle Laban. \n\nAfter Jacob’s dream in Bethel, he moved to Haran and lived with his uncle Laban. He fell in love with Laban’s younger daughter, Rachel. “I will work seven years for you if you allow me to marry Rachel,” said Jacob. Laban agreed and after seven years of work the wedding day arrived, but the next morning Jacob realized that his uncle had tricked him. He had not married Rachel, but Leah, her older sister! Jacob’s uncle Laban had switched his beautiful daughter Rachel with her ugly sister Leah! Jacob was angry, but Laban assured him he could have Rachel too if he worked another seven years.\n\nThat was not the last time Laban tricked Jacob.  Laban tried to take as much from Jacob as he could. But God always blessed Jacob with more. God was keeping the promise he made to Jacob in his dream. He was with him, caring for him and protecting him. He also gave him many sons through his wife Leah. \n\nFinally, after twenty years, God told Jacob to return to the land of his father, but this wasn’t easy. Laban tried to take away the sheep that Jacob had earned. So while Laban was away, Jacob packed up his wives, his children, his servants, and his livestock and began the journey back to the land of Canaan returning with much, much more than when he left.\n\n1. How did Laban trick Jacob? Laban tricked Jacob into marrying Leah instead of Rachel. He also tricked Jacob out of the sheep that he earned.\n2. How did God protect Jacob? God gave Jacob abundant blessings- children, servants, and livestock. He also protected him from his uncle Laban.\n\n**God blessed Jacob abundantly, just as he promised. When we belong to God like Jacob, he will bless us as well.**",

                        "value": "*Lesson Principle:*      \nGod sanctifies weak, helpless sinners to fulfill his plan of redemption.\n\n----------\n\n\n**Genesis 29 – God shows favor on those whom man has rejected.**\n\nThe story begins with Jacob traveling almost eight hundred kilometers to Haran, arriving at a well surrounded by sheep, waiting for the stone to be removed. How Jacob meets one of his future brides is similar to the way the servant of Abraham met Rebekah over ninety years earlier. After seeing Rachel for the first time, it is clear he is smitten. After staying with his uncle Laban for a month, he proclaims his intentions to marry Rachel. Laban decides to exploit his love-struck nephew by sneaking his older, less attractive daughter into the marriage bed. Laban was able to make the bride swap because it was customary for the bride to be veiled on her wedding day. To add to it, Jacob probably had been celebrating and drinking. The result was that Jacob ended up with two sister-wives. Marrying two sisters was not God’s will. God forbids this practice later on in the law that God gives to Moses. This deceptive act of polygamy resulted in a lifetime of grief and bitterness between these two competitive sisters. Regardless of Jacob’s love for Rachel, there is a stronger emphasis on God’s favor for Leah.\n\n1. What are the contrasts between Rachel and Leah?\n2. How is Laban’s deception similar to Jacob’s deception of Isaac?\n3. What is Leah learning about God through her marriage to Jacob?\n\n\n**Genesis 30 – Conflict, faithlessness, and superstition are no match for God’s sovereign plan of redemption.**\n\nAs Jacob’s family increases, there is evidence of God keeping his promise. There is also a reminder of the conflict that comes from acting in contrast to God’s plan for marriage (Gen. 2:24). Regardless of the sin in Jacob’s family, God grants Jacob 10 children in under seven years. The list of Jacob’s children is central to the story. There are three reasons for this. First, It shows God’s faithfulness in keeping his promises. Second, It gives the background and birth of the tribal heads of Israel. Finally, it will help explain much of the tribal rivalry that follows in Israel’s history. God wanted the self-righteous Israelites to realize the context of jealousy and superstition out of which the twelve tribes emerged. This chapter shows God’s favor to Jacob through his growing family and in his success in business. Despite Laban’s attempts to trick Jacob into staying, changing his wages, and stealing from him, God remained faithful to keep his promise. Jacob demonstrated his complete trust in God’s provision by striking a deal with Laban that would seem to be a considerable risk for Jacob. His pay would consist of animals not yet born. These animals would seem less desirable because of their markings and color. Laban separated the spotted, striped, and speckled animals from the solid-colored animals in Jacob’s care to ensure Jacob didn’t cheat on his deal. Jacob must have known a lot about raising livestock. Jacob knew that when a striped, spotted, or speckled marked animal was born, he could breed that gene selectively to produce flocks and herds of similar markings. Jacob believed the rods he used stimulated this process. Whether or not his practice with the rods was a proven method or just a superstition, it is clear that God was working to bless Jacob and increase his herds. Jacob confirms this very thing in the following chapter.\n\n1. What are the similarities and differences between how the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) handled bareness?\n2. In what way do Rachel and Leah demonstrate faith (or a lack thereof)?\n3. How are man’s efforts and God’s efforts compared and contrasted in this chapter?\n\n\n**Genesis 31 – It is unifying to obey God.**\n\nJacob’s initial plan of a seven-year commitment turned into twenty. The conflict brewing between Jacob and Laban had reached a pinnacle, and God made it clear to Jacob that it was time to leave. Jacob revealed to them the dream he received from God. Because he knew Laban would do whatever he could to keep Jacob in Haran, they snuck away while their father was absent. The motives for Rachel stealing her father’s idols may not have been religiously motivated. Although it may have been motivated by her superstitious belief that these idols helped fertility, she may have had other motives. In this culture, the one who possessed their father’s graven gods would receive the most considerable inheritance. Whatever her reasons, it is clear that Rachel lacked faith in God’s provision. When Laban finally caught up with Jacob and his family, he was angry and proclaimed Jacob had stolen from him. Since Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the statues, he was emboldened to make his defense. What is plain to see in this chapter is that God was the one working to protect Jacob and bring him safely back into the promised land. Laban was adamant that everything Jacob owned belonged to him, but because God had warned him, he did not press his claim of ownership. Instead, the two men make a covenant, and Laban invokes the name of God as a witness to the covenant. Neither party trusted the other. Still, both were willing to put their trust in God in keeping the other faithful to the covenant.\n\n1. How would you describe Laban’s character?\n2. How is faith in God demonstrated in this chapter?\n3. What does this chapter reveal about God?\n\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n\n**Romans 5:6-11 – God intervenes for sinners to save them from sin and future judgment.**\n\nJacob went into Haran weak, helpless, and very selfish. He had nothing and could do nothing to ensure God’s blessings to him. Jacob was brought to Haran to learn that God’s unwavering love is not based on how loveable Jacob was but on the consistency of God’s character. God’s act of love came to Jacob when he needed it most and when he was the most undesirable. Not only this, but God also protects Jacob, intervening on his behalf to save him from his father-in-law’s anger. We, too, can experience that same love and grace when we put our faith in Jesus Christ. Paul’s point is that we (just like Jacob) are neither good nor righteous. God demonstrates his steadfast love by dying for sinners. Paul goes on to talk about the “much more” of Christ atoning work on the cross. It is not only that God paid the price for our sins, but Christ intervenes on our behalf to save us from the wrath that will come to all who do not believe in Jesus. We need to understand that God is for those whom he has chosen. God saves us and works to make us into the kind of people that reflects his love and righteousness. God does not choose people because they are almost good or have potential. God chooses sinners because he desires to reveal his plan of reconciliation in a way that displays his glorious love.\n\n1. What are the words that describe those for whom Christ died?\n2. What are the benefits of being justified (made right with God)?\n3. Share your story of how you became a follower of Christ?\n\n$$$$$$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

                        "value": "**A narrative for the young based on the lesson’s text**\n\n**Day 1 - Genesis 29:1-27**\n\nAfter his encounter with the Lord at Bethel, Jacob continued north in his mission to find a wife. Unbeknownst to Jacob, his arrival in Haran resembled that of his grandfather’s servant, Eliezer. Spotting a well in the distance, Jacob headed right for it. A large stone rested atop the cistern causing three flocks of sheep to wait patiently beside it in the dry heat. \n\n“Where are you from?” Jacob asked the shepherds surrounding the well. The shepherds looked up, surprised to see a foreigner who, from the look of him,  had been traveling for quite some time.\n\n“We are from Haran,” they replied hesitantly. Weary of the outsider, they asked, “Where have you come from?” \n\n“I have come from the west. Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor? He is my uncle,” he inquired. \n\nAt the mention of family, the men were put at ease and said, “Yes, we know him.”\n\n“How is he? Is he well?” Jacob asked.\n\n“Yes, he is very well…Oh, look, there is Rachel! See the shepherdess with the flock of sheep headed this way? She is Laban’s daughter. You can ask her.”\n\nSeeing the young approach, Jacob was struck by how beautiful she was. “It’s the middle of the day. Don’t these sheep need to get watered and get back out to pasture? You need to make room for Rachels’ sheep,” he asked.\n\n“We cannot until all the flocks are gathered, and then the stone is rolled away. Then we can water all of them because the well cannot be left uncovered for too long,” the shepherds explained. But Jacob had stopped listening; his focus turned to Rachel as she arrived with her sheep. Rachel’s eyes were dark and beautiful. Captivated, Jacob could not look away.\n\n“Dddddo, your sheep need water?” Jacob nervously asked as he began to move the stone away from the well. When her sheep were fully engaged in quenching their thirst, Jacob came close to Rachel, gently held her shoulders, and kissed her cheeks. “I am Jacob, your cousin,” he greeted her, tears dampening his face as the emotion of his journey and the separation from home began bubbling to the surface. \n\n“You are my cousin?” Rachel asked, a little shocked by the tender feelings and affection of the strange man before her. \n\n“Yes, my mother, Rebekah, is the sister of your father, Laban,” Jacob explained.\n\n“Oh, I see,” her eyes waxing like the moon. Before he could continue, Rachel began running back the way she had come. “Wait there!” she called out. “I will send my father.” \n\nJacob took a seat near the well while he waited, watching Rachel’s flock of sheep in her absence. Lifting his eyes to the sky, he imagined the ladder he had seen in his dream and said, “Yahweh, I know you are with me in this place, just as you promised. You have brought me to the most beautiful woman!” \n\nRachel’s sheep had scarcely finished drinking from the well when Jacob caught sight of his uncle, Laban, running down the path towards him with Rachel close behind. When he got to Jacob, his uncle embraced him and kissed him on both cheeks. So full of eagerness to welcome his visitor, Jacob could hardly escape the older man’s grip. “Welcome, Welcome! I hear you are my nephew. Is this so?” Laban asked. \n\n“Yes, Yes I am,” Jacob answered, stealing a glance at Rachel, who begun to gather her sheep. \n\n“Tell me all about my sister,” Laban said as the two men walked back to his house. \n\nA month went by while Jacob stayed as a guest at his uncle Laban’s. As each day passed, Jacob found himself spending more and more time with Rachel and her sheep. They worked side by side, feeding them, watering them, and dressing wounds. Over time, Jacob’s love for Rachel grew. \n\nOne day, Laban came to Jacob and said, “You have been helping out quite a bit here. The time has come for you to start getting something in return for the work you are doing. You are no longer a guest. You are family. So, how would you like to be paid? \n\nThe moment had arrived. Jacob knew this was his chance to ask for the woman he had wanted to marry since the moment they first met. “I will work for you for seven years if you give me your daughter, Rachel, as my wife,” Jacob proposed.\n\n“Seven years is a very generous offer. But, what about my daughter Leah? She is the oldest and should be given in marriage before her sister,” Laban said.\n\n“Rachel is beautiful, and I love her,” Jacob explained. “Leah is a sweet girl, but she does not have the beauty of he sister. Leah’s eyes are plain and a bit dull. I have chosen Rachel. I wish to marry her.”\n\nLaban shrugged and said, “Okay, It is better to give her to you than any other man that comes along. I accept your offer. Stay here and serve me.”\n\nSo, Jacob began his seven years of service, but it only seemed like a few days to him because he loved Rachel so dearly. He was simply happy to be near her. Finally, on the last day of the seventh year, Jacob went to Laban. He said, “I completed the seven years of service we agreed to. Now, please give me the wife you promised to me.”\n\n“Yes! Let’s celebrate with a feast,” Laban announced. Gathering the people of his household, Laban instructed his servants to cook plenty of food and decorate the tents. That day, everyone ate their fill and enjoyed the celebration of Jacob’s marriage. Finally, evening came, and darkness fell, so Laban said, “Let our bride and groom share the wedding tent.”\n\nWhile Jacob waited in the tent for his new bride, Laban quickly gathered his daughters, dressing Leah in Rachel’s clothes and covering her face with a veil. He said, “Stay here, Rachel! Leah, you come with me.” Laban exited the tent, headed for Jacob, Leah at his heels, and Rachel left behind in a cloud of confusion and tears. The night was particularly dark with a new moon above them as Laban shoved his eldest daughter into Jacob’s tent. Hearing no objections, Laban crept back to his own house.\n\nShortly after dawn, Laban awoke to the sound of his name being shouted across the camp. It wasn’t unexpected; it was simply a matter of time before Jacob realized that he had sent Leah to his tent and not Rachel. Laban rose from his bed and stepped outside. Sure enough, Jacob was on his way towards him. “What is this that you have done to me? I worked seven years for Rachel. That was our agreement! Why have you deceived me?” Jacob shouted. \n\n“In our country, we don’t give the younger before the firstborn is married,” Laban said with a sly grin. “Leah is your wife now. If you commit to working for me another seven years, I will give you Rachel as well.”\n\nEven in his anger, Jacob knew he could not refuse his uncle. He wanted Rachel, not Leah, and he would do anything to get her.\t \n\t\n**Who did Jacob meet by the well?** He met Rachel, his uncle Laban’s daughter.\n\n**How did Laban trick Jacob?** After seven years of work to get Rachel, Laban tricked Jacob into marrying Leah instead.\n\n**Do you think it was God’s will that Jacob only marries Leah?** We know from the beginning of Genesis that God intended man to have one wife. Jacob never asked if Rachel was the wife he intended for him; he only assumed it was. He could have been content with Leah, the wife God had allowed him to have.\n\n**Day 2 - Genesis 29:31-30:24**\n\nLeah was devastated. Always the ugly one in comparison to her sister’s beauty, she had suffered feelings of shame for years. Still, the rejection from Jacob had caused an even deeper wound. Rachel had always been her father’s favorite, his shining star, and so Leah was overlooked. Now, he had deceived a man into marrying her. She felt more worthless than ever before. Her father wanted to get rid of her. Her new husband was so discontent that he was willing to sign on for another seven years of labor after marrying her younger sister.\n\n“Zilpah, how can I bear this pain?” she cried out to her servant. “I am unloved, rejected, and alone!” Zilpah tried to comfort her mistress, but nothing helped. Leah’s sorrow was like a heavy cloak clinging to her shoulders until one day her belly began to grow. A new hope lifted her head. “Yahweh has given me a gift, Zilpah,” Leah whispered to her servant, excitement in her voice. “He has given me a child,” she said with a smile. Zilpah embraced Leah, happy to see some life in Leah’s eyes. \n\nMonths later, Leah delivered a healthy baby boy. “It’s a son!” she cried out with excitement. “The Lord has seen my pain and blessed me with a son, so I will call him Reuben.” As Rachel watched with envy as her sister celebrated, her patience was wearing thin as she waited for her child. She imagined giving Jacob more than just one son like her ugly sister. Rachel would give him ten sons. “Ten sons from the woman that he loved- me,” she reminded herself. “not Leah.” Jacob didn’t even want Leah. Rachel turned and walked out, leaving her sister to the other woman’s attention admiring her new baby. \n\nReuben grew and, with his growth, brought affection from his father, Jacob. Leah watched him laugh and play with his son with the continued hope that Jacob would love her now that she had given him a son. However, her sister made sure his attention remained on her. Leah expected Rachel to bear a child soon, but instead, she had another son. With gratitude, she named him Simeon. “Yahweh, you have heard my cries and answered. You have blessed me, and you have blessed Jacob. Thank you, Lord,” she said.\n\nYears passed, and Rachel had not fallen pregnant. Instead of a baby growing inside her, the only thing she carried was anger and jealousy toward her sister. Rachel found herself distancing herself more and more from her sister. She couldn’t bear to be around her or her children. They were a constant reminder of her failure as a wife. Levi, Leah’s third son, came along, and Rachel could take it no longer. “Give me a child, Jacob!” she shouted in a burst of anger. “You have given Leah three sons! Why won’t you give me even one!” \n\nJacob had heard enough. Day in and day out, Rachel sulked, complaining that she was barren. Now she blamed him! His suppressed irritation finally burst into anger as he shouted back, “Am I, God? Have I withheld children from you?! Certainly not! I don’t control your ability to have a baby!”\n\n“I can bear it no longer! I will die if I don’t have children!” she fought back, bursting into tears. Uncertain of what to say, Jacob left the house, leaving Bilhah, Rachel’s servant, to comfort her. \n\nLess than two years had passed when Leah gave birth to her fourth son, Judah. She praised the Lord for his bountiful blessing toward her and her husband, yet her sister became desperate. “I am giving you Bilhah, my servant, to be your wife.” Rachel said to Jacob one day. “She can have children on my behalf. At birth, I will adopt them as my own,” she explained. \n\nJacob agreed, and it wasn’t long before Bilhah had one son and then another. Rachel named them Dan and Naphtali. Prevailing over her sister had caused Rachel’s hopes to rise, but she could still have a child of her own. Leah had ceased to have children, so she followed her sister’s example and gave Jacob’s servant, Zilpah. Two sons were added to Jacob’s family from Zilpah. Leah called them Gad and Asher. With the number of babies and children being added to Jacob, the Lord’s blessing was clear upon him. Nevertheless, Rachel was determined to have a child of her own. During the wheat harvest, Reuben explored the field and came upon some mandrakes rooted in the soil. Beneath the leaves, he spotted the orange-colored berries and picked some. Returning home, Reuben found his mother sitting with his aunt Rachel and the servants cleaning the wool. “Look what I brought for you, Mother,” Reuben said to Leah. \n\n“Thank you, son! These are mandrakes,” Leah told him. \n\n“Mandrakes!?” Rachel asked, hovering over Leah to get a look. Unaware of how precious his discovery was, Reuben was startled at his aunt’s reaction. “Reuben, this is an extraordinary plant. It can help women have babies,” Rachel told him, her eyes wide. Reuben shrugged and left the women to marvel over his gift. \n\n“Please, Leah, give me some of these to me,” Rachel asked. \n\nLeah wrapped them up in her robe, holding them close, and said, “Rachel, you have drawn all my husband’s attention toward yourself. You have taken him from me! Now you want to take my son’s mandrakes as well? I rarely see Jacob. He spends his time with you, yet I was his first wife and the one to give him sons. I will not give you my son’s gift also.”\n\n“I need those mandrakes, Leah! They have the power to help me conceive a child. I must have them!” Rachel asked, becoming desperate. “Will you trade them?  I will let Jacob stay with you tonight if you give me some mandrakes in return,” she pleaded.\n\nEager to be with her husband, Leah agreed to the exchange. That evening, Leah went out to the field to meet Jacob. She explained that he would stay with her that night because she had sold her sister some mandrakes. Contrary to what Rachel assumed, the mandrakes did not affect her. Instead, Leah was the one who became pregnant. She bore Jacob two more sons, Issachar and Zebulun, and then a daughter, Dinah. “Surely,” she thought, “my husband will want to spend more time with me now and live in my house.” I have given him six sons. But, to Leah’s disappointment, Jacob continued to dwell with Rachel.\n\nOn the verge of hopelessness, Rachel had almost given up the idea of having children of her own but, the Lord remembered her. He heard her pleas and caused her to become pregnant. It wasn’t long before Rachel was holding a son in her arms. She named him Joseph.\n\t \n**What did Leah look like compared to Rachel?** Leah had soft eyes which were not as attractive as Rachel’s bright eyes.\n\n**Which of Jacob’s wives did God favor?** He favored Leah. She was the wife he had intended for him, so God blessed her with many sons.\n\n**Have you ever felt like Leah- alone, rejected, and unloved?** How did God comfort you in the midst of that? The Lord has a special place in his heart for the despised and rejected. \n\t\n**Day 3 - Genesis 30:25-43**\n\nFourteen years had passed since Jacob had met Rachel by the well. They finally had a son, and Jacob was ready to take his family back to the land God had promised them. However, Jacob knew that the biggest obstacle to leaving was Laban. “I am asking you to send me back to my home and country, Laban,” Jacob requested. “I have served you all these years for my wives and children. You know how hard I’ve worked. Now please send me home.”\n\nLooking panicked, Laban said, “You can’t leave! Please, you must stay. Interpreting the signs and omens surrounding you, Jacob, I see that Yahweh has blessed me because of you. With his favor upon you, I have been able to profit greatly from you living here. What can I give you to stay?”\n\n“You are right. You had very little before I came, and now, you have an abundance under my care. Your livestock has multiplied because wherever I turned, the Lord has blessed you. But I must provide for my household. Will you allow me that?” Jacob asked.\n\n“What can I give you to stay?” Laban asked once more.\t\n\nJacob, pausing for a moment, considered his deceitful uncle. Laban was crafty, but he could not let this man keep him from the blessing Yahweh had promised him. So, he offered him an easy deal, which avoided any possibility of becoming debited to his uncle again.\n\n“You do not need to give me anything. I will continue to take care of your livestock if you allow me to pass through the herd today and remove every spotted, speckled and black sheep or goat, every undesirable animal because of its markings. These will be my payment for being your shepherd. If you ever find any plain white sheep or goats in my herd, you can count them stolen, for all the unblemished of the flock belong to you.”\n\n“Deal!” Laban said eagerly, already hatching a scheme to cheat Jacob out of those animals. Gathering his sons, Laban said to them, “I am putting you in charge of all my speckled and spotted sheep and goats. Quickly go and separate them from the herd before Jacob takes them. Take them to the farthest pasture and keep care for them there.” \n\nLaban’s sons gathered the livestock and journeyed three days away, leaving Jacob with nothing but unblemished sheep and goats. When Jacob saw what Laban had done, he couldn’t help but feel defeated. “How will I ever get home now?” he asked himself as he stared at the large flock of solid-colored livestock. But his zeal for the blessing God promised prompted him to find a way around his uncle’s plan. Using a trick he learned, Jacob collected plane, poplar, and almond branches. Then he peeled strips of bark away, leaving white stripes exposed from the wood. Placing the sticks in the drinking trough, Jacob separated the more robust sheep. They began to breed more often when they drank the water, giving Jacob many striped, spotted, and black sheep. \n\nWhen Laban saw how many speckled, spotted, and streaked sheep and goats Jacob had accumulated, he was furious. “This can’t be!” he said. “How are there so many speckled and spotted animals and so few solid colored? You can’t take all these. It’s not a fair wage. From now on, you can only take the spotted animals.”\n\nNot surprised by Laban’s lack of integrity, Jacob gritted his teeth and continued the breeding plan. One sunny afternoon as Jacob watched the flock hear the well, he drifted off to sleep, dreaming of striped, speckled, and spotted goats mating with the herd. Then the voice of the angel of God called out to him, “Jacob,” he said.\n\n“I am here and listening,” Jacob replied. \n\n“Look and see that I am causing your flocks to increase. I see what Laban has done to you, but I am for you. If Laban says you only keep the spotted animals, I will cause spotted goats and sheep to be born. If he says you may only keep the striped animals, then I will cause striped animals to be born. I am the God of Bethel, where you built a pillar and made a promise to me. Now, get up and leave this land. Return to the land of your fathers,” said the Lord.\n\nBefore long, Jacob’s flocks had not only increased immensely, but the Lord had blessed him with servants, camels, and donkeys as well. Through Yahweh’s favor, Jacob had beat Laban at his own game.\n\t  \nWhat did God give to Jacob? God gave Jacob many children, animals, and servants. He also protected him from harm.\nJacob and Laban made a deal to care for his livestock in return for the spotted, speckled, and striped sheep and goats. How did Laban try to cheat Jacob out of the animals he had promised? Every time Jacob’s animals multiplied, Laban changed his wages and took the more significant portion of livestock. \nHow did God make it clear that he was on Jacob’s side in the conflict with Laban?\n\n**Day 4 - Genesis 31**\n\t\nWith all of Jacob’s prosperity came trouble with Laban’s sons. Assuming Jacob had cheated their father out of his livestock, they blamed him for the depletion of his wealth. Even Laban had begun to treat Jacob differently. In the past, Laban had always reaped the rewards of Jacob’s favor with the Lord. Now, the blessing was falling on Jacob alone, and Laban was feeling the effects of it. His selfish regard for Jacob was diminishing because he was no longer benefitting from the relationship. \n\t\nNevertheless, amid rejection, the Lord spoke to Jacob and said, “Return to your home, Jacob, the land of your fathers. Remember, I am with you. You are not alone.”\n\t\nHeeding the Lord’s command, Jacob called Leah and Rachel out to the field with him as he watched his flocks. “Listen,” he said to them. “Your father is no longer friendly to me. The God of my father has abundantly blessed me, and he despises my success. You know I have worked so hard for your father all these years, yet he has cheated me and refused to pay me what he promised many times over.”\n\t\nDespite their conflict, Leah and Rachel agreed on this. They both nodded at Jacob, affirming his observations. Greed was what drove their father, and they had seen him pursue it at the expense of his relationships, especially with their husband. \n\t\n“Despite all of this, the Lord has been with me,” Jacob continued. “I have not been harmed because of God’s protection. He has taken your father’s livestock and given them to me. When your father said you may have the spotted sheep, then God caused only spotted sheep to be born, and when your father said you may have only the striped sheep, God caused only striped sheep to be born.”\n\t\n“When I was journeying to this land, he appeared to me in a dream and promised to go with me, and he has. Then he came to me again when I was here with the sheep on the day. He told me to return to the land of my fathers.”\n\t\n“There is nothing left for us here,” Leah said. “There is no inheritance.”\n\t\nRachel shook her head sadly, “We are like strangers to him now.”\n\t\n“He has sold us and spent our money. It’s only right that the wealth God has taken from him belongs to our children and us. Whatever God has said to you, we should do,” Leah advised.\n\t\nJacob waited until Laban had traveled away to shear his sheep to make his escape. He gathered everything the Lord had given him, packed up his camels and donkeys, and made ready to set off for the land of Canaan. Leah and Rachel waited patiently astride their camels while Jacob finished the last of the preparations.\n\t\n“Where are you going?” Leah asked Rachel as her sister dismounted her camel. \n\t\n“I will just be a minute. I want to get something.” Rachel replied as she hurried off to their father’s house. When she returned, she was hiding something in her robes.\n\t\n“What did you take from father?” Leah asked accusingly. \n\t\n“I have to ensure my fertility,” she explained as she climbed atop her camel. “So, I took father’s household gods.” Rachel carefully packed them into the seat beneath her. \n\t\n“That’s not a good idea, Rachel,” Leah said. “Those are one of our father’s most precious possessions.”\n\t\n“I don’t care. Father doesn’t deserve to have them,” Rachel said, justifying her actions.\n\t\nBefore her sister could convince her to return them, the train of animals began to head out. Jacob’s household had increased so much in number that they stretched far and wide. Herds of sheep and goats, camels, donkeys, servants, and children began the long trek to the land of Canaan, all behind Jacob, their father, husband, and master. They crossed the Euphrates River and headed south towards Damascus. \n\t\nThree days had passed when Laban returned home and realized that Jacob had left without telling him. Furious, he assembled his sons and servants and pursued Jacob for seven days. Less than a day behind him, Laban stopped to rest, and when he slept that night, the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Be careful you don’t say anything to Jacob that is good or bad.” When he awoke, his anger had dissipated. Constrained by the Lord, he knew he could do nothing to him.\n\t\nThe next day Laban caught up to Jacob and his household in the hill country of Gilead. Jacob came out to meet him, and Laban said, “Why did you leave when I was gone and take my daughters away like prisoners? Why didn’t you allow me to send you off with a goodbye party?”\n\t\nJacob nervously paced the dry ground. “I was afraid. That’s why I left in secret. I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.”\n\t\n“It is within my power to harm you for this,” Laban continued. “But your God spoke to me last night and told me not to say anything good or bad to you. So, I will not keep you from returning to your homeland. Although, I would like to know why you stole my gods.” \n\t“I don’t have your gods! You can search our camp, and anyone who has them shall pay. Death is the penalty for theft,” Jacob declared, clueless that Rachel was the culprit. \n\tLaban went into each tent, digging through Jacob’s possessions, desperate to find them. Inspecting Leah and Rachel’s tents thoroughly, he finally asked Rachel. She was still sitting astride her camel with his gods still tucked beneath her. “I am sorry, my lord, but I cannot come down from my camel,” Rachel explained to her father. So, he continued searching, finding nothing.\n\t\n“That’s enough!” Jacob shouted, losing his patience. “What have I done to you? How have I sinned that it would cause you to pursue me like an enemy? Now you are rummaging through all of my possessions!”\n\t\nLaban looked up, caught off guard. Jacob had never stood up to him like this before. He had always been able to manipulate his son-in-law any way he saw fit. \n\t\n“For twenty years, I have worked for you, and your livestock has flourished because of it. When your animals died, I took on the loss myself! I have painstakingly served, and yet you have taken advantage of me at every turn. If the God of my fathers had not been with me, I would be leaving empty-handed because you would have taken it all away. God has seen what I have been through because of you. That’s why he rebuked you last night.”\n\t\n“I adopted you into my family!” Laban countered. “All that I see here belongs to me. Those are my daughters, my livestock, my children. I am Lord over all of this,” he said, consumed by his pride. “But what can I do? Your God is on your side. So, let us make a covenant.”\n\t\nJacob agreed and set up a stone as a pillar, and his men collected more rocks to make a pile around it and called it Galeed. The pillar marked separation between the two men, and they agreed not to cross it. God would be their witness and judge between them if one of them harmed the other. Then Jacob offered a sacrifice to the Lord. The following day Laban said goodbye to his daughters and grandchildren. He departed peacefully and headed back to his home in Haran.\n\t\n\t\n**Where did God tell Jacob to go?** He told him to return home to the land of his father.\n\n**How was Jacob able to escape Laban?** How did God protect him? Jacob and his household left in secret while Laban was away for three days. God instructed Laban not to harm him. They were eventually able to part in peace. \n\n**Did God abundantly bless Jacob because he was a good man?** No. God blessed Jacob because he chose to. Jacob was not a very upstanding character. In God’s nature of mercy, he blesses his children even when they are the most unlovable. He died on a cross for us, not because we were good but because we were weak and sinful.\n\n**Jacob encountered trial after trial, but God’s blessing was always upon him. Just like Jacob, when we belong to the Lord, his favor is always upon us, even at our weakest moment.**",

Ham and Japheth were busy chasing a mouse down its hole.  “Father told all of us to collect the stones, not just me,” Shem reminded them. “There is another laying on the side of that slope over there.

Before they had set out, Japheth had gathered a discarded piece of the ark to make a temporary platform for hauling the heavy rocks. Then he fastened the pair of oxen to it. Faithfully standing their ground, the men added stone after stone to the pile. When the pallet could hold no more, they headed back towards their camp outside the marooned ark. Eager to return, the healthy oxen put all their strength into dragging the stones back to Noah with their new twin calves following close behind. \n\n“Well done!” said Noah, when they arrived. He helped his sons roll the stones and lift them onto the partially built table. “The only thing we are missing is a large flat stone for the top. Try looking downhill from the ark,” Noah directed. So, gathering the oxen once more, Shem and his brothers went searching for the last piece to their stone table. Sure enough, they found just what they needed, right where Noah had suggested. After two hours of pulling, dragging and lifting they were able to get the giant rock back to the altar. It took all eight of them, Noah, his wife, his sons, and his son’s wives, to lift and place the stone a top of the base of the altar. “At last, we are ready to make a sacrifice to the Lord,” Noah announced. \n\nEarnestly desiring to worship, Noah wasted no time gathering the clean animals and birds. “We offer this sacrifice to you, Yahweh,” Noah said, as he began to shed the blood of each of the seven clean birds and each of the seven clean animals. Even one of the oxen was taken from its harness and put on the altar. Noah continued, saying, “Thank you for your mercy towards us in bringing us safely through the waters of the flood. We know we deserve punishment for our sin, but instead, you have shown us favor.” The smoke rose from the altar to heaven as Noah kneeled before it with his family behind him. Then, overhead the dense clouds parted, and the sun began to warm their faces, like a sign of pleasure from their creator. \n\t\nBefore sunset that evening, Noah stood near the altar, enjoying the soft glow of the coals, as they gave an ambiance of heavenly peace. Noah looked across the mountains of Ararat, from where the ark sat. He could see pools of water amidst an empty landscape. There were no trees, no grass, no crops. Only mud, rock, and water remained. “Noah,” a voice called out. When he turned, Yahweh was there with him. “It will take time, but life will begin to flourish once more,” Yahweh paused. “Noah, I have promised myself that I will never again curse the ground because of man, and I will never strike down every living creature as I have done. While the earth remains, there will be changing seasons and one day will turn into the next. They will not stop.” Then Yahweh raised his hands and blessed him, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill this earth. From now on, every wild beast, bird, fish, and creeping animal will be fearful of you and I give to you the power of life and death over them. Just as I gave you the plants to eat, everything that moves may be food for you. I give you everything. There is one exception, do not eat the blood of animals. Life is sacred and the blood is the symbol of each life. So, you must not eat it. Remember, men do not have the power of life and death over one another. I have created you in my image, making every human life special. If one man sheds the blood of another man, then I will require a payment from the violator,” Yahweh explained to him with a great deal of seriousness. Noah nodded his head and after a brief moment, Yahweh clutched his shoulder and with a smile said, “Now, as I told Adam and I said before, be fruitful and multiply, fill the earth!” \n\nSomething happened inside of Noah that night. As he laid down next to Emzara to sleep, he felt a warmth that did not come from his wife or his bed, it came from deep within. He was experiencing a new kind of love he had never felt before. The weight of responsibility he had been carrying since the death of his grandfather, was gone. Like a sack of grain, it had been poured out and Yahweh had been the one to empty it. All the suffering he had endured on the ark had been worth it. His creator loved him, and he was blessed. \n\n“Noah, wake up, wake up!” Emzara said, as she shook him out of a deep sleep, looking anxious. “Do you hear the rain? It sounds like it did when we first entered the ark!” Noah sat up and listened to the beating sound of rain drops on the roof overhead. They had been living and sleeping out of the stranded ark until they could eventually move down the mountain to dry ground and build a more permanent home. When Noah heard the sound, his mind went back to those first few weeks aboard the ship. His breathing increased, as he jumped up to look outside. \n\n“Father!” Ham shouted as he came running through the rain, drenched. “Look at all this rain. God is going to flood the earth again!” he said, frantically. “Ham, calm down. The Lord has blessed us and promised me that he will never curse the ground again. We will be safe,” Noah reassured him as he looked at the sky. The clouds were black, and the rain was falling hard, but as he looked to the east, he saw the clouds part and the early morning sun appear behind the pouring rain. Then, something strange caught his eye. A faint line of red and then purple ran across the sky, slowly even more colors emerged: green, yellow, orange, blue. Its beauty was unlike anything he had ever seen. A chill ran up his back, as the low rumble of thunder sounded in the distance, but instead of dying out, the sound rumbled around the sky until it gradually became a voice from heaven. “Noah, I establish my covenant with you and your children and your children’s children and with every creature on this earth. Never again shall all living creatures die by the waters of a flood and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth. I promise,” said the Lord Yahweh. Noah’s sons had gathered around him, captivated by the frightening voice that seemed to roll down the cord of vibrant color stretched across the sky. “This is my bow I have set in the clouds. It is the sign of the covenant I make between me and you and every creature for all future generations. When I make the days cloudy and the bow is seen in the sky, I will remember what I have promised you and every living creature. The waters will never again become a flood to destroy the earth.”\n\nThe rumbling faded and the voice of the Lord ceased. The only sound to be heard were the infrequent drops of rain upon the ark. Noah and his sons stood motionless, unable to take their eyes from the rainbow before them. As they peered down the mountain side, they could see the half circle from end to end. “Look,” said Japheth, breaking the silence. “God’s bow isn’t pointed at the earth; it’s pointed at heaven.” Noah looked at his son and smiled as he raised his arms to heaven giving thanks to the Lord.\n\nWeeks later, Noah and his family had packed up all they could carry and headed to lower ground. Searching for a place they could call home, they came across an area where a few olive trees had survived and new grass had begun to grow beneath. “This soil looks fertile and there is a spring of fresh water. This is an ideal place to begin growing food. We will stop here,” Noah announced. The large caravan of livestock, building supplies, and food came to a halt. There was much work to be done. “Ham and Japheth, you care for the livestock. Shem and I will set up the tents,” Noah directed. Emzara and her daughters began to haul water from the spring so they could prepare what little food they had. Shem’s wife, Medah, would soon be having a baby, so the whole family had worked hard to keep her healthy and safe. As the only individuals on the face of the earth, they counted each life as extremely precious. “Medah,” Shem called. “Our tent is ready. Come and get settled so you can rest.” When the tents were complete, and the livestock settled, Shem looked around him and said, “You are right, Father. This is a wonderful place to begin again.” \n\nOver the years, Noah’s home grew, in size and in number. Shem’s wife gave birth to a healthy boy named, Elam. Soon after, Japheth and Ham had sons and daughters as well. In no time, the tents were full of small hands and feet and cries in the night. Those cries at night only made the days more joyful, as Noah and Emzara appreciated the abundant blessing of the Lord even more. But children were not the only thing of abundance. Noah’s new endeavor to become a farmer grew more and more successful with each year that passed. Collecting the leftover seeds from the ark, Noah began by planting grains and then vegetables and finally some fruit. It seemed that every plant he grew and cared for produced in a bountiful way, but there was one vine that seemed to produce far more than anything else. What had once started as a few small grape seeds salvaged from the ark, had become a large healthy grapevine. When it was time to harvest, Noah crushed the grapes, filling one clay jar after another with juice. Finally, he discovered a way to seal off each jar, hoping to save it for as long as possible. \n\nHarvest continued as Noah and his sons worked hard to collect as much food as possible before the cool air turned cold. Finally, when everything was completed, all the families gathered together to celebrate the bounty God had given them by preparing a delicious feast. Noah brought out a jar of his grape juice, which, over the weeks, had turned into a delicious wine. Everyone enjoyed a cup of it with the meal, but Noah enjoyed it more than everyone and drank one cup after another. By the end of the evening, he stumbled off to his tent.\n\nAs his sons prepared everyone for bed that night, Ham said to Japheth, “I will check on Father. He was acting ridiculous this evening.” Ham walked over to Noah’s tent. “Father,” Ham called. “Are you okay?” Ham poked his head through the door to the large tent and saw Noah laying across the floor without his clothes on. “Ha!” exclaimed Ham loudly. “Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,” he laughed, barely able to contain himself. When Japheth heard the loud commotion, he came running with Shem right behind. “He’s naked! Father’s naked in there!” Ham tried to explain between snorts. Shem and Japheth did not share in the sentiment of humor that Ham found to be so entertaining. “Stop it, Ham!” shouted Shem. “You are dishonoring our father! This is no laughing matter. He is exposing his own shame. We must cover him.” \n\n“Oh, come on, Shem, it’s not a big deal. It’s funny,” replied Ham. “It is a big deal. Don’t you remember the story of the garden of Eden? The Lord properly covered Adam’s shame, so we must remain covered out of respect for Yahweh,” explained Japheth. “I will get a robe. Wait here outside the tent and don’t look at him,” said Shem. When he returned, Shem and Japheth laid the garment across their shoulders and walked backwards towards Noah and gently covered the nakedness of their father. \nWhen morning came, Noah emerged from his tent, looking for his sons. When all three had joined him in his tent, he spoke directly to Ham and said, “I know what you did to me. Therefore, your son Canaan is cursed. He will be a servant to his brothers.” Ham hung his head low. Then Noah turned to Shem. “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem and let Canaan be his servant. And for you Japheth, may God enlarge you and your sons, and may you dwell in the tents of Shem and may Canaan be your servant.” \n\nNoah’s prophecy did not sit easy with his sons, but it was coming to pass. Things were never the same between them. Eventually, their families spread further and further from one another. A few hundred years later, Noah and Emzara passed away. By that time, his son’s families had grown so large they had become multiple clans with their own languages, fulfilling what the Lord had commanded years ago when they had stepped off the ark. \n\t\n**The Lord promised to never destroy the earth with a flood again, but he has also promised that one day he will destroy it with fire. Those who repent of their sin and trust in Jesus will be brought safely, like Noah, to a new heaven and new earth.**",

It’s a special sign made by God. After Noah and his family left the ark, they wanted to say thank you to the Lord for keeping them safe in the midst of the flood. So, they built a big stone table and gave an offering.  The Lord was pleased with what they gave him. He smiled from heaven and said, “I promise I will never again destroy the earth with a flood.” \n\nThe next day, heavy rain began to fall. Noah’s family heard thunder and were scared that there would be another flood. But then, the sun poked its head from behind the dark clouds and something strange happened. A faint line of red and then purple ran across the sky, slowly even more colors emerged: green, yellow, orange, blue. They stretched across the sky in a huge arch. It was a beautiful rainbow! Then Noah heard a voice from heaven, “Noah, this is the sign I give you to remind you of my promise to never again destroy the earth with a flood. This is my covenant.” Then the Lord blessed Noah and his family and told them to multiply and fill the earth.\n\n**God promised to never flood the earth again, but one day our earth will come to an end, and God will create a new heaven and new earth for those who love him.**"

As we will see over and over throughout scripture the basis of covenants is blood sacrifice.  In response to Noah’s acceptable offering, the Lord makes a covenant with Noah that he would never destroy the world through a flood again. This promise is not based on mankind’s ability since we continue to be sinful, but rather on the promise of God. Within this covenant God ensures that he would continue to sustain life, but within this covenant there are also dynamic changes in the way man would engage with one another and with the world God had provided for him. \n\n1. What are the conditions of the covenant that God established?\n2. How does the covenant change the relationship between mankind and God’s other creatures? \n3. What does a rainbow in the cloud tell us about God?\n\n**Genesis 9:18-29 – The rest of Noah’s life is marked by sin, a curse, and a blessing.**\n\nThis passage of scripture marks the transition from Noah to his descendants. it is sad to see Noah, a man whose story is marked by faithfulness and obedience to God end in shame and obscurity. It is a reminder of man’s struggle with sin, and that we are continuously in need of a patient and merciful God.  The shameful act committed against Noah in his drunken state is not made clear. We know that it included Ham and his son Canaan acting shamefully, and that Noah’s other two sons acting honourably. Regardless of the sin committed, the consequences of the event would bring negative effects on the offspring of Canaan.  It would be important to note that the time Moses is writing this story the Israelites were getting ready to enter the land that God promised Abraham that was being dwelt in by the Canaanites.  \n\n1. How would you describe the last 350 years of Noah’s life?\n2. How was Canaan cursed?\n3. What are the particulars of Noah’s blessing for Shem and Japheth?\n4. What is the relationship between sin and shame?\n\n**Genesis 10 – All the nations of the earth stem from Noah.**\n\nIn this chapter Moses presents an ethnographical genealogy that lists nations and people. Although some individuals are mentioned, they are primarily used to indicate ancestors of particular people groups. Many bible scholars today believe the people groups mentioned in Genesis 10 can be divided into three groups with relative certainty. In general, the descendants of Ham settled in North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean coast. The descendants of Shem in Mesopotamia and Arabia, and the descendants of Japheth in Europe and the greater parts of Asia Minor.  There are a couple interesting things to point out about the way in which Moses writes this chapter. First, Moses writes in reverse order from Japheth to Shem. Another thing to notice is that Ham’s line gets the most attention in this chapter. It is also an interesting thing to note that throughout Old Testament history the dominating kingdoms were from the line of Ham.  Regardless of their role in history, or importance to this story of Genesis, the description of these nations and kingdoms is a testament of a covenant keeping God.\n\n1. Why do you think Moses starts chapter 10 with the line of Japheth?\n2. In this chapter, what is repeated and what or who do you see being emphasized?\n3. How does this chapter testify to the promises of God?\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n**2 Peter 3:1-13 – The great and final judgement is still to come.  **\nIt is the subject of time and the pending day of the Lord that Peter wants his readers to be aware of. The flood came because of the wickedness and ungodliness in the world. However, it was not a complete destruction since the world remained in one piece (although very altered) and sin remains in the hearts of people. Since the days following the flood God has demonstrated his patience and mercy towards sinners. What Peter calls “the last days” refers to the time from the first coming of Messiah to his return. On this day God will not simply flood the earth, but completely destroy creation with fire before he makes the new heaven and earth.  Praise God for Jesus!  Not only does God give us his son who is the means of salvation, but he is enduring with patience so that sinners have the opportunity to repent and live according to God’s holiness. \n\n1. What are some similarities between the days before the flood and the time before the final day of Judgement?\n2. What is being commanded in this passage?\n3. What do the false teachers in our day say about the day of the Lord?\n4. What are practical ways we can live in holiness and godliness?",

                        "value": "**A narrative for the young based on the lesson’s text**\n\n\"Abram.\"\n\nAbram stopped. He looked across the river. He looked up to the sky. Turning, he looked behind to where he had come from. Where had the voice come from? “Hello?” Abram called out. “Is someone there?” he asked.\n\n“Abram.” \n\nHe heard the voice again, but this time it was closer. His heart pounded. Was he losing his mind? \n\n“Abram, I am your creator, Yahweh,” the voice said. \n\nAbram fell to his knees, the air exiting his lungs as his face hit the dirt. This wasn’t just a voice. The presence of holiness made him want to sink below the earth. \n\n“Abram,” the voice said again. “I am calling you to go, to go from your country, and your family, and your home to the land that I will show you. I will make you into a great nation and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. Those who bless you, I will also bless. But those who dishonor you, I will curse. In you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”\n\nThen as suddenly as the presence had come, it vanished. An eerie stillness was all that remained. It took Abram a long time to emerge from the dirt. Slowly rising to his feet, his mind swirling from what he had just encountered, he tried to focus on the words he had heard. How could this God, this God whose name was Yahweh, intend to give him so much? He was unworthy of such a gift. He had never been a spiritual man, rejecting the ways of his father, Terah. He didn’t know Yahweh, yet he believed the words he had spoken. \n\nBy the time Abram returned to the house in Haran, there was little doubt whether he should obey the words of Yahweh. “Sarai,” he called. “You better sit down. I have some incredible news!”\n\nSarai came to the doorway, anxious to see her husband. “Abram, your face is covered in dirt. What happened?” she asked. Abram stopped in front of the door taking a moment to appreciate the beautiful wife he had been blessed with. She was dressed in a robe of purple and scarlet, accentuating the dark hair that slipped beneath her veil. “Fetch some water and a cloth,” she instructed a servant girl. Sarai knelt at Abram’s feet and gently cleaned his face and hands. \n\n“Sarai, the voice of Yahweh spoke to me!” he told her, his voice beginning to shake.\n\n“Who is Yahweh?” she asked.\n\n“He is the creator, the invisible God, Sarai. He told me to go to a new land and promised blessing and many children. I don’t understand it all. Yahweh spoke of making me into an entire nation. We are yet to have even one child. How can this be so? Yet as he spoke, something in me believed what he said to be true.” \n\nSarai looked down at her hands holding the dirty cloth. Even the slight mention of her barrenness brought feelings of shame to the surface all over again. She tried to brush it off, but her face remained flush as she focused her attention on her husband. There was silence for several minutes before Sarai spoke. “I go where you go. If you believe this God, Yahweh, then we should do as he says. Where is this land we are to go to?” she asked.\n\n“I think he intends us to continue on to Canaan, like father had set out to do,” Abram answered.\n\n“But, Abram, that place is a wilderness. The people there are savages. Why would he want us to go there?”\n\n“The journey will surely be hard, but I trust this is where he is leading us,” he replied. Sarai took a look around her home realizing in a moment her life was about to change forever.\n\n“Then we better start packing,” Sarai encouraged. \n\nAbram wasted no time in gathering their possessions and preparing the servants to leave Haran. Even his nephew Lot, who had been under the care of Terah, was excited about the new possibilities that awaited them in a new land. \n\nThe journey was difficult, even more difficult than Abram had ever imagined. Supplies were harder to find as they got further and further from the cities. The road from Ur to Haran had been well worn when they had traveled years earlier, but as they got further and further from Haran, the road eventually turned into a spotty path. The land was desolate, and food was scarce. Abram instructed the servants to lead the company along the rivers, so at least water was available. They made their way west and then south, crossing rocky desert that slowly became mountainous which became the most arduous part of the trip. Two servants lost their lives to illness and one due to an attack by thieves. Months had passed by the time they descended from the mountains and passed through the land of Canaan until they came to Shechem. \n\nAs Abram and his family entered the valley a giant oak tree lay before him. It was perfectly centered between two mountains. The shade of the tree enticed Abram, so he rested beneath it, drifting off to sleep while the servants set up camp. The sun had almost disappeared behind the mountain tops when Abram opened his eyes. A breeze chilled him as it rustled the leaves of the tree above him. In the distance, a man was walking towards him. Abram quickly sat up and rubbed his eyes. When he looked again, the man was even closer. His heart began to pound. It was most likely a Canaanite from a nearby tribe. If they encountered one another, things could get violent. Stumbling to his feet, Abram grabbed his staff as the man entered the shade of the oak tree. Abram’s strength seemed to melt, and his staff hit the ground with a thud. The man was definitely not a Canaanite and he wondered if the man was even a man at all. A soft glow seemed to come from his robe. \n\n“Abram,” the man said. Abram recognized the voice immediately. It was Yahweh. He dropped to his knees. “Abram, you have come,” he said with a smile. “See this land around you, to your children and your children’s children, I will give this land. This is my promise to you.”\n\n“Lord Yahweh, I …” Abram drifted off as he realized no one was there. The gentle rustle of the leaves was the only response he heard. Abram whispered a word of thanks and began to collect stones laying under the tree. After stacking them carefully, he stepped back to inspect his altar. He wanted to remember this moment. This moment when the Lord appeared to him. \nWhen the altar was finished, Abram returned to share the news with his wife. He looked across the valley as he walked to the tents. Yahweh had promised to give him this land that surrounded him. It seemed too good to be true. \n\nThey remained in Shechem a while, enjoying the peace of the valley. Then Abram heard of a great priest in Salem who worshiped El Elyon, the God Most High. He decided to venture further south towards Salem and explore some of the land Yahweh would bless him with. So, he gathered his servants, his wife Sarai, and his nephew Lot and they continued on into the hill country where he pitched his tents between Bethel and Ai. Abram got to work building another altar to Yahweh, anxious to worship and praise the Lord. Sarai and Lot joined him as they called upon the name of Yahweh, thanking him for his blessing. \n\nNot long after stopping near Bethel, Abram decided to continue on. He was getting desperate to find enough food to feed the flocks as well as his servants. The area was dry causing Abram more and more concern as to how long the drought would last. They moved their tents even further south, but vegetation became even more scarce. The next season, it was clear that the lack of rain had become a severe famine. Concerned for the well-being of his entire camp, Abram decided to take them to Egypt to find food near the waters of the Nile. \n\nAbram knew he could not enter Pharaoh’s kingdom undetected. His prominence came with the responsibility to present himself and his family to Pharaoh. Knowing that king’s like Pharoah took whatever they liked and eliminated everything they didn’t, caused Abram to search for a way to keep himself safe from Pharoah’s greed. Sarai’s beauty caught the eye of almost every man who had ever seen her. Surely, Pharoah would see her and desire to have her for himself. Abram loved his wife for much more than her outward beauty. Her fearless devotion to him was unmatched. Her service to him was unwavering through their long arduous journey. \n\n“Sarai, you are a beautiful woman,” Abram said to her as they sat in their tent one night on the road to Egypt. “If the Egyptians see you and know that you are just my wife, they will kill me and take you. I think it’s better if we keep the fact that we are married hidden. You are my half-sister after all, so if you explain that, they will respect me, and I will be spared for your sake.”\n\nSarai reluctantly nodded and said, “Yes, my Lord.” A little unsure of the position that would put her in, but nevertheless obeying the desires of her husband. Just as Abram had predicted, they entered Egypt and Sarai’s beauty was reported to Pharoah by the princes. So, he took her into the palace to become one of his own women.\n\nAbram was beside himself over the separation from his wife, but there was nothing he could do. He had brought his household into the land of Pharoah and so he had to live by his rules or risk his life. He waited and waited, until one day, one of Pharoah’s servants came to his residence with an order to give Abram fifty female sheep. “How is my sister, Sarai?” Abram asked. “Can I see her soon?” \n\n“She is with the other women,” the servant said. “I have not seen her.”\n\nEach week, Pharoah’s servants brought one gift after another. Abram now had oxen, donkeys, male and female servants as well as all the sheep. He and Lot frequently went to see Pharoah and visit with Sarai until he received news that they could no longer enter the palace. Pharoah had fallen sick, and eventually the illness had swept through the palace. Many were sick although Sarai remained one of the exceptions. \n\nNot long after the illness had gone, a hailstorm came through the city and surrounding areas, destroying crops and killing livestock. When a prince of Pharoah arrived to assess the damage to Abram’s livestock, he was astounded to see that every one of Abram’s animals remained unharmed. So, the prince quickly returned to Pharoah to point out the news. Abram began to wonder, was this Yahweh? Would he afflict Pharoah with plagues simply because he took Sarai? It was after the swarm of locusts who plagued the Nile valley that Pharoah called for Abram.\n\n“What have you done to me? Your God has afflicted me.” Pharoah shouted at Abram. “Why didn’t you tell me Sarai was your wife? I took her as my own wife because you told me she was your sister!” Abram’s hands trembled and he stared at the floor, wondering if Pharoah would kill him now. Instead, he motioned to his prince who brought Sarai forward. “Now, here is your wife. Take her and go!”\n\nWhen Abram and Sarai got to his residence, they found Pharoah’s servants instructing Abram’s men to pack up and prepare the animals to depart. They were quickly escorted out of Egypt with much more than they had arrived with. Yet, Abram felt that there was now something lacking in the relationship with his wife. He had broken her trust and brought shame upon their house. \n\nWhen they crossed into Canaan, Abram took his household north through the Negeb and continued back up towards Bethel to where he had built his first altar. It was time to make a new start. He knelt at the altar, asking the Lord for forgiveness, knowing he had failed as the leader of his home. \n\nWhile in Egypt, Abram and Lot both had increased their flocks and their servants. Still healing from the famine, the land could not sustain them both. Not long after they returned to Canaan, the herdsman began to argue and fight over the amount of grazing land each of the livestock were allowed to eat from. Abram even noticed that his nephew began to be more distant, choosing to eat in his own tent instead of joining Abram and Sarai. Finally, desiring to have peace in the camp, Abram took Lot up to the mountain above their camp and said, “The space in this valley is not enough for both of our households. With the Canaanites and Perizzites surrounding us, one of us must find new place to dwell. We cannot live with this strife between us. We are family.” \n\nLot began to look at the land around him, nodding in agreement. “You choose which direction you would like to go, and I will go the other,” Abram said to his nephew. \n\nLot stared at his uncle for a moment, stunned by Abram’s generous offer. Then without hesitation he turned from Abram and pointed in the direction of the city of Zoar. “I choose all of the Jordan Valley,” he said to his uncle. Abram gave a slight smile and nodded. He was not surprised by his nephew’s quick decision.  It was easy to see why he had chosen the area; it was green and well-watered. It wasn’t so different from the land of Egypt they had just come from. Abram embraced his nephew, pleased that they had found a solution, but also grieved by the reality that he was sending his nephew away. He had been like a son to him. As lot walked back down the mountain, Abram watched him for a time. This was not something he had planned, but he was now putting his trust in Yahweh’s plans and promise. \n\nNot long after Lot had separated from Abram, the Lord spoke to Abram again and said, “Look around at this place, Abram. Now look to the east and then to the west. Look to the north and then the south. I will give you and all your offspring the land that you see. Your offspring will be so great in number, they will be like the dust of the earth. Can anyone even count the amount of dust particles on earth? For the number of your children will be just as many. Now, walk through this land and see what I will give you.”\n\nSo, Abram obeyed Yahweh and moved his tent to Hebron, where he built another altar to the Lord, all the while considering what the Lord had promised him. This land would be his? How would he know when it belonged to him? The dust of the earth seemed like an imaginable number. How could he possibly have so many offspring? He had a hundred questions, but one thing he did know, what the Lord promised would come to pass. He trusted him, no matter how unbelievable it sounded.\n\n**When we believe in Christ, we become a child of Abram, becoming an heir to the promises of God. **",

One day the Lord spoke to him and made him a promise. Do you know what a promise is? A promise is when someone says, “that will surely happen” or “I will definitely do that.” Has your mom or dad ever promised you something?\n\nThe Lord promised Abram that he would give him many children, he would have so many children, they would be like the stars. Have you ever tried to count the number of stars in the sky? 1…2…3…4… it seems like they go on forever. God also told Abram to leave his home in Ur and go to the land of Canaan. So, Abram, his wife Sarai, and his nephew Lot, packed up their home and moved to this new land the Lord had promised them. It was a long journey. They traveled through the desert and over the mountains until they came to a place called Shechem. At Shechem the Lord appeared to Abram and promised once again to give the land that Abram was standing on, to his many children. Abram believed what the Lord had promised him, and he carefully stacked a pile of stones there at Shechem to remember what the Lord had told him. \n\nWhen we trust the Lord, we can become a child in Abram’s great family as well.

                        "value": "*Lesson Principle:*   \nFaith is the right response to God’s call.\n\n\n----------\n\n**Genesis 12:1-9 – God’s blessings are predicated on his call to follow him.**\n\nThis passage marks an important shift in Genesis that brings our focus from Noah and his sons, to Abram, a descendant of Shem. Everything prior to this passage was background information to set up the foundational story of God’s promise to Abram which will eventually lead to the redemption of all nations. The Lord begins by calling on Abram to leave everything behind and follow him to a new land God has promised him. Abram believed that the Lord who called on him was the one true God, in contrast to the people around him who worshiped idols. It’s this simple faith which sets Abram apart. Upon hearing God’s call, he was willing to leave family, country, and religion to claim what he had been promised. The end of chapter 11 reads as if they were going in the direction of Canaan, but Terah stopped them in Haran. It seems Abram left his father in Haran in pursuit of God’s call. Although Abram did not fully obey God’s command by stopping in Haran, it is important to remember that the first steps of faith are not always giant ones. \n\n1. What is the list of specifics that make up the promises that God made with Abram?\n2. What would Abram need to risk or surrender in order to receive what the Lord had promised him?\n3. What would the risks be if God called you today to leave your home and follow him?\n\n**Genesis 12:10-20 – God builds faith and demonstrates his commitment to fulfill his promises.**\n\nLife’s circumstances are the arenas in which our faith is built. Although the Bible does not say that Abram was disobedient for leaving the promised land, it’s clear that his problems began when he reacted to a crisis before consulting God. Nevertheless, it is wonderful to see how these circumstances are used to build Abram’s faith in God. As Warren Wiersbe writes, “a faith that can’t be tested can’t be trusted.” In an attempt to preserve his own life, Abram almost squandered the promises of God by giving away his wife, Sarai. This passage reveals the Lord’s commitment to keep his promise to Abram, as well as confirming to Abram his need to seek Yahweh in every circumstance. \n\n1. How does this story reveal the immaturity of Abram’s faith?\n2. In what way is Pharaoh’s character godlier than Abram?\n3. Do you remember a moment in your life when you made plans without consulting the Lord?\n\n**Genesis 13 – Abram demonstrates a stronger faith in God**\n\nAfter Abram returns to Canaan, we are introduced to Abram’s nephew Lot. Since Abram was without children of his own, Lot would have been his rightful heir. However, in order to continue building Abram’s faith in God, and to make room for the rightful heir, God needed to begin putting distance between Abram and Lot. He accomplished this by providing them both with great wealth. It was the abundance of their wealth that created tension as the herdsmen from both families struggled to find pasture for their animals. In response to this, Abram does something out of context with the culture of that day, and contrary to his earlier actions which caused all the trouble in Egypt. Abram surrenders his right to have the first choice of land, giving the preference to his nephew instead. Since Lot was assumed to be the heir to Abram’s name and wealth, Abram partitioned the land between them. Lot’s response to this generous offer exposes his willingness to trade a close relationship with the Lord for worldly comforts. Lot’s choice to move away, made a final break between him and Abram.  \n\n1. How does Abram demonstrate stronger faith?\n2. Considering the original audience of Israel, why do you think Moses described the Jordan valley as “like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt”? \n3. What does Lot’s choice of land reveal to us about his character?\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n**Galatians 3 – True Children of Abraham have faith in God’s promises. **\nThe book of Galatians is probably the fiercest of all of Paul’s letters, because the false teaching of the day was leading people away from the truth that salvation comes through faith in Christ alone. The truth of sinners being brought into a right relationship with God through faith alone is not new information. It was established in Genesis 12 when God called Abram. This message of faith is for us when we simply believe in the promise of salvation through Christ. As a result of faith, we are brought into the family of God, partaking in the blessings of Abram. Paul makes it clear that there are no extra rules or laws needed to be followed in order to receive salvation. It is faith in Christ alone that saves us and makes us heirs to the promised blessings that were given to Abram. Eternal life with Christ is the ultimate blessing that we receive when we believe the message of the Gospel. So as heirs to the promise of Abram we can surrender the pleasures of this world; enjoy the blessings we have in Christ and anticipate the blessings yet to come. \n\n1. Based on this passage, what were the false teachings that were spreading through the churches in Galatia?\n2. What is the Gospel message that the Genesis 12 and 13 preaches to Gentiles?\n3. What are the promises we receive in Christ, and how much to you value them? (i.e., make a list of God’s promises and order them from greatest to least). \n\n$$$$$$$",

                        "value": "*Lesson Principle:*  \nPeople struggle to love God\n\n----------\n\n\n**Genesis 4: 1-7 – True worship begins with a right attitude towards God.**\n\nAlthough chapter 3 ends in sadness with God driving Adam and Eve from the Garden, Chapter 4 begins with a glimmer of hope. A once deceived Eve gives birth to a son and in response to God’s blessing and provision, she gives thanks. The expression of gratitude or worship to God continues as the story moves ahead in time to when Eve’s two sons bring their offering from the bounty of their respected occupations. Unfortunately, the presence of sin wrenches the narrative back into turmoil with the bitterness that envelops Cain’s heart after Yahweh finds his sacrifice unacceptable.  The text does not give us enough background to know what kind of offering this was, or if God had instructed them to bring a specific offering. The text speaks more about the attitude of the worshipper towards God. Worship, from the beginning, has been a matter of the heart.\n\n1. What are the ways God is being worshipped in these verses?\n2. What differences do you see between Cain’s offering and Abel’s?\n3. What does Cain’s reaction say about his attitude toward God?\n\n\n**Genesis 4:8-16 – A wrong attitude towards God corrupts relationships with others.**\n\nEven after receiving a warning and a call to repentance from God, Cain allows sin to run its course. James 1:14-15 tells us that the process of sin begins with the temptation from our own desires. This leads us to coming up with sinful ideas, and when we allow sin to master us it leads to death. Cain does not heed God’s warning but allows his anger to open the door to sin. It is clear from the very beginning that as sin disrupts the relationship with God, it results in corrupting the relationship with one another. The fact that Cain does not show remorse or even sorrow for the death of Abel tells us how hardened his heart had become. He only shows sorrow for the consequences he must now suffer for his sin.  The story concludes with a picture of Cain being sent out from the land, his family, and the presence of Yahweh (Land, Seed, Blessing).\n\n\n1. How are Cain’s relationships (with God and man) affected by his actions?\n2. What did Cain find so unbearable about his punishment?\n3. What do all these verses (1-16) say about God?\n\n\n**Genesis 4:17-5:32 – God is faithful to preserve a family of faith.**\n\nThe story of Cain continues into the 6th generation, with the story of Lamech’s two wives and four children. Although Cain was cast out of the presence of the Yahweh, his life and descendance were not without their contribution to the development of society, culture, and technological advancement. However, their values are set in stark contrast with those of Seth’s line who seem to be committed to spiritual values. The story of Cain ends, and Moses continues with the line of Seth.  It would be easy to skip over this long list of names, but if it is in the Bible, it is important. The line from Seth to Noah is not marked by innovation or acts of strength or world power like Cain’s family. They are marked by 10 generations of faith. It is not likely that Seth was the third son of Adam and Eve. Chapter 5 tells us that Adam had many other sons and daughters. They are not important to the story, and more than likely went the way of Cain (Jude 11), leaving no one to fulfil the promise given to Eve in the garden. God keeps his promises by providing Seth (“substitute”) to be another Abel who would live in reverence towards God. The promise God made to Eve in the garden is set in motion with the birth of Seth, who we now know to be the first of a chosen line which would culminate in the birth of Jesus our Messiah. \n\n\n1. What are some important contributions that we see Cain’s descendants making to culture and civilization?\n2. Who are some of the names that stand out in Seth’s family tree?\n3. Why do you think it is important for Moses to list all 10 generations to Noah?\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n\n**1 John 3:11-24 – The motive of true worship is love.**\n\nThe Apostle John contrasts the difference between the blood that Cain shed when he killed his brother, and the blood that Jesus shed when he laid down his life for us. Between these two persons lies the tension between love and hate, Christ and the world, empty words and acts of love. John lays out the commandments that are given to us by Christ which form the principles for living.  John gives simple, although not always easy, instructions for how to love the way God loves, and how we as believers can trust in him by relying on his Spirit to help us live as we should.\n\n\n1. How did Cain act in opposition to the way we are called to live?\n2. What are the things that John says we can “know”? \n3. What do our deeds say about our heart?\n4. God gave Cain an opportunity to do the right thing. What does John say the right thing to do is? \n\n$$$$$$$\n\n\n\n",

                        "value": "**A narrative for the young based on the lesson’s text**\n\n\n“Mama! Mama!” called Seth. Frightened, Eve dashed from her tent, frantically looking for her precious son. But he wasn’t far. Crouched next to the fire was little Seth in tears as he held up his palm. “I burned my hand,” he declared. Adam reached Seth first, scooping him into his arms, and carrying him towards the river with Eve close behind. After they had soaked his hand in the cool water, Seth climbed into Eve’s lap. “You scared me, Seth. I have lost two sons; I could never lose you,” she said. Seth looked puzzled, “I had two brothers?” he asked. \n“Many years ago, your Papa and I lived in a beautiful garden with Yahweh. It looked very different to where we live now. There were flowers to look at and food to eat everywhere. We were never cold, never hungry, and never sad. Yahweh provided so abundantly, and most of all, he was there with us. Yet we were not satisfied with what he had given. Disobeying him, we ate from the one tree that Yahweh told us not to eat from. He is our loving creator and we betrayed him.”\n\nEve sighed as she looked to Adam. “Son,” Adam said. “My sin that day changed our lives forever and has affected every person in our family. Forced to leave the garden that day, we could no longer live with Yahweh. Although life is difficult now, Yahweh has kept his promise. After much pain, your mother was able to bear a son. We named him Cain. Not long after, she had a second son, Abel.”\n\n“Two brothers? Wow! Where are they? Can I meet them?” Seth asked. Adam ignored the questions and continued with the story. “Cain, the oldest, was a farmer. He was a tremendous help to me as I put so much effort into growing food. We cultivated the ground and planted seeds. It seemed that every plant and every seed that Cain cared for grew and flourished. Cain’s ability as a farmer helped our food supplies grow. Proud of his success, Cain delighted in the abundance he was able to provide our family. Unfortunately, he failed to see that his success was due to the blessing of Yahweh.”\n\n“Abel, his younger brother, grew to be a shepherd. Although he put every effort into caring for the sheep, they were never a strong herd. The older sheep battled sickness and the younger, were eaten by predators. Abel loved those sheep like they were his own children but despite everything he did, there were only a few healthy ewes. I spent a great deal of time with Abel, helping him to care for those sheep until one eventually gave birth. Overjoyed, Abel blessed the Lord and asked if we could give an offering. Cain was in the middle of a rich harvest at that time, so I encouraged them both to bring an offering to Yahweh. When Cain heard this, sadly, he became irritated and said to me, ‘Yahweh, kicked you out of the garden, forcing you to provide for yourself, why should we give anything back to him. Our abundant supply of food came from the sweat of my brow, not Yahweh’s.’ His reaction was unexpected. Despite how hard life had become after the garden, your mother and I accepted the consequences for what we had done and continued to love our creator. But Cain had taken on a different perspective, he had no fear of Yahweh. I tried to explain the goodness of God, his provision and his mercy. It was Yahweh himself who had covered our shame in the garden. But in my attempt to convince him, Cain’s irritation only turned to resentment. Nevertheless, Cain gathered a portion of his harvest and prepared it for God, probably out of a sense of duty.   \t\n\nAbel, on the other hand, was overcome with gratitude towards Yahweh for providing such a healthy baby lamb. Since it was his firstborn, he wanted to give it back to him as an offering. Abel desperately wanted to please Yahweh, so he spent a great deal of time preparing his firstborn lamb. Carefully, he cleaned and cared for it until he was ready to give it to the Lord. Then, together, Cain and Abel brought their offerings before the Lord. Cain laid out the grain he had harvested while Abel gently sacrificed his lamb presenting it to Yahweh. As soon as Abel had stepped back, fire came down from heaven, like a bolt of lightning, and burned up Abel’s offering. The Lord was pleased with Abel’s sacrifice. So Abel fell to his knees praising his creator. But Cain just stood above him, waiting for Yahweh to show some regard toward the portion he had brought. The longer he waited, the angrier he became. ‘Just leave Abel,’ he said, ‘Clearly Yahweh has accepted your offering. You may go now,’ he said to his brother through gritted teeth. The sun had gone down by the time Cain gave up and returned home. Yahweh had not been pleased with Cain’s offering and so Cain left it in the field to rot. For days, the fumes of Cain’s fury permeated our home and Abel’s love for Yahweh only seemed to fuel it.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, Yahweh came to visit. We prepared a large meal like we usually did when he came to see us. Abel was delighted when Yahweh told him how pleased he was with the offering he had given of his firstborn lamb. When Cain heard this, his eyebrows furrowed, and his face burned hot with rage. \n\n‘Why are you angry Cain?’ the Lord asked. ‘It’s not fair!’ Cain shouted. ‘My offering was just as good as Abel’s. How could you approve of his and not mine?’ \n\n‘Cain, if you do what is right, will I not accept you? But if you do not do what’s right, sin is crouching at the door waiting for you. Its desire is to control you, but you must rule over it,’ Yahweh said.\n\nThe following day, Cain offered to help his brother with the sheep. Your mother and I had assumed that Cain’s anger had gone and love for his brother had returned. We happily watched as our two boys walked into the field together to tend the livestock. However, only one returned home that evening. Your mother waited up all night for Abel, but he never came. Then Yahweh appeared. He immediately went to Cain and said, ‘Where is your brother, Abel?’ Cain looked away and replied, ‘I don’t know where he is. Am I supposed to be responsible for him?’ Yahweh said to him, ‘Oh Cain, what have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to me from the ground.’ \n\nWhen your mother and I heard these words, we were broken. Cain had lashed out at his brother that day in the field and killed him. He disregarded the words of warning that Yahweh had offered, and he let sin take control. \n\nOh Seth, sin is so dangerous, and with it comes punishment and death. Yahweh punished Cain that day. He, no longer, had success in planting and harvesting. Since he had spilled his brother’s blood on the ground, the Lord cursed him from the ground. He was also forced to leave and become a wanderer on the earth. This frightened Cain and he pleaded with the Lord, ‘My punishment is too much for me,’ he said.  ‘You are driving me from the land, I can no longer be in your presence, and I will be a fugitive. Whoever finds me will kill me!’ \n\n‘Not so!’ Yahweh told him. ‘If anyone kills you, he will pay for it seven times over.’ The Lord put a mark on Cain so no one would attack him. Then, Cain left us and the presence of the Lord. We didn’t just lose one son, but two that day. All because of Cain’s choice to let sin control him. Cain has had many children since then, but they have remained far from the Lord, living in violence. \n\nAfter many years of sadness, Yahweh restored our joy by choosing us to be parents to another son like Abel- that’s you, Seth. We will teach you to love Yahweh and to love one another, as Yahweh has loved us. This love is expressed in the way we worship him. Someday you will teach this to your children and your children will teach it to their children, so that the love of Yahweh and one another will continue from generation to generation.”\n\n**Our worship is most acceptable to the Lord when we love him, and we love others.**"

Cain became a farmer. He planted seeds and then harvested the plants. His brother Abel was a shepherd. He watched over and cared for the sheep. One day, the brothers each brought a gift to the Lord God. Abel happily presented him with his best lamb and God was pleased. Then Cain gave the Lord a portion of his harvest, but it was not his best portion because he did not love him. So, God did not accept Cain’s offering. This caused Cain to become very angry! His smile fell into a frown and his face turned bright red. The Lord said to him, “Sin is crouching at the door like a lion, Cain. Don’t let him come in.” But Cain did not listen to God. \n\nThe next day Cain took his brother out to the field and when they were alone Cain struck Abel and killed him. Cain was not sorry for what he had done, so the Lord sent Cain away to become a wanderer on earth. Adam and Eve were sad over losing their two sons but many years later, the Lord gave them another son like Abel who loved God.

                        "value": "*Lesson Principle:*   \nGod is able to shelter the righteous from the destruction of the wicked.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n**Genesis 18: 16-33– The man of faith intercedes for sinners.**\n\nIn the previous chapter we see Abraham running here and there, frantically preparing a meal for his guest. In this next scene, he is simply standing reverently before the Lord. As the two angels make their way toward Sodom, Yahweh lingers a while to let Abraham in on his plans. This action should cause us to pause and meditate on the fact that God took the time to reveal his plans to Abraham. Of course, this new information burdened Abraham greatly. It was not that long ago that he rescued that city from the Chaldean kings when he rescued Lot. His concern was primarily for Lot, but it would seem logical that he would have concern for the people there as well. Abraham does not seem to be questioning God’s judgement but appealing to God’s justice for the righteous who may still live in the city. In this scene, Abraham steps into the role of intercessor for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. This is the correct posture for a righteous man to take before the Lord. What is interesting is that Abraham was not pleading for mercy, but justice. A just and holy God could not destroy righteous believers with wicked unbelievers.  It was Abraham’s hope that there would be enough righteous people in the city to spare the city from destruction. The fact that God was willing to spare the city for the sake of just 10 righteous reveals to us his unending patience and mercy. \n\n1. Why did God decide to reveal to Abraham his plans concerning Sodom and Gomorrah? \n2. What does this say about God’s relationship with Abraham?\n3. What do you notice about Abraham’s intercession for the people in these two cities?\n\n**Genesis 19:1-29 – God is resolved to save the righteous from the destruction of the wicked.**\n\nThis chapter is about the spiritual decline of Lot, which teaches the reader the sad and inevitable consequences of making friends with the world. The chapter begins with us finding Lot sitting in the gate of the city. It would seem that Lot gradually became more and more accustomed to the city life, and ultimately chose to abandon his tent and take up residency within the city walls. The push to move within the city walls may have come from the experience of being taken captive, or perhaps the lure of the city lifestyle enticed him to give up his tent. Whatever the reason, the angels find Lot at the city gate, meaning that it is likely that Lot became a person of importance in Sodom, since the places at the city gate were reserved for people of prominence and authority.  After their arrival it did not take long for the city to show its true colors. The violence and wickedness of the men outside the door of Lot’s home was so great, that they even turned their anger towards Lot, even after he shamefully offered up his two young daughters to the wicked mob. Thankfully, the angels intervened, ultimately needing to literally take Lot and his family by the hands and drag them from the city. After allowing the culture of the city to sway his family, Lot was a man without influence. The people of the city would not listen to him, his son’s-in-law would not listen, and even his own wife and children were swayed by the influence of sin and self-indulgence. It was only the unrelenting mercy of God that saved them from destruction. \n\n1. What does this story reveal about God’s resolve to keep his promises?\n2. How did Lot fail to be a righteous influence?\n3. How can you be a righteous influence in the city where you live?\n\n**Gen 19:30-38 – Fear leads down a dark path away from the light of righteousness.*\n*\nThe story of Lot does not end well. Perhaps he saw the sin in the city of Zoar and thought God might decide to rain down fire there as well. Perhaps he saw the influence the world was having on his daughters, so he decided to hide them away in a cave. We are not sure exactly what the reason for his fear was, but we do see that he allowed his fear to motivate his actions. It was fear that drove him out of the city and into a cave. Alone and with no future prospects, his daughters decided to take matters into their own hands. The sinful act his daughters committed with him is the final story of Lot, and it is unfortunate that this story marks his legacy. As a result of his incest, his sons, Moab and Ben-ammi, establish two nations that will cause Israel a lot of grief in the future. One scholar summed up Lot’s life well when he wrote, “It is possible for a righteous person to live close to sin, but he may barely escape with his life.”\n\n1. What are the key decisions in Lot’s life that led him to live in a cave?\n2. What evidence do we see in this passage of Lots righteousness? \n3. How does seeing Lot’s life help you reflect on your own pattern of decision making?\n \n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n**2 Peter 2:1-10 – God guards the righteous from the eternal consequences of sin.**\n\nIn the second letter from the Apostle Peter, an emphasis is made on the recognition and avoidance of false teachers. In this passage Peter is reminding the reader that whenever God’s people have gathered to proclaim the truth, false teachers and prophets are always nearby. The danger of these false teachers and prophets is that they arise within the church, secretly and seamlessly eroding the doctrinal foundation. When believers give in to lawlessness, it is natural to adopt a lower standard of morality because sensuality appeals to the flesh. Peter gives conditional clauses (if…then) as examples to support his argument. Peter wants to make it clear that if God did not spare the wicked then, he will surely not spare them now. The story of Noah and Lot also serves as examples of how God punishes the wicked, and shelters the righteous. It is important to know that God does not always save the righteous from suffering in this life, but he guarantees to guard us from the eternal judgment that he delivers to unrepentant sinners.\n\n1. What are the marks of a false teacher?\n2. Why does God choose to rescue the righteous?\n3. How do we interpret the times when God chooses not to physically save the righteous?\n\n$$$$$$$\n",

Doctors rescue people from sickness and lifeguards rescue people from the water when they can’t swim. Did you know that the Lord is our ultimate rescuer? \n\nOne afternoon the Lord and two angels came to visit Abraham. They took him up to a hill that looked over the city of Sodom and Gomorrah. The Lord said, “Abraham, I am planning to destroy these cities because the sin has become too great there.”\n\n“Oh no!” Abraham said. “My nephew Lot and his family lives there. What if you find fifty people who believe in you there? Will you still destroy it?”\n\nThe Lord answered and said, “No Lot. I will not destroy it if I find fifty righteous people.”\n\nThen Abraham asked again, “What if there are only twenty people who believe you? Will you still destroy it?” \n\nThe Lord said again, “No, Lot. I will not destroy the cities if I find twenty righteous people.”\n\nThen Abraham asked once more, “Please, if there are only ten people who trust you? Will you still destroy it?”\n\n“If there are only ten, I will not destroy it, Abraham,” the Lord assured him.\n\nThen the Lord’s two angels, headed down into Sodom, but they could not find even ten people who had faith in God. So, God told them to find Abraham’s nephew, Lot and his family and take them out of the city. \n\n“Run for your life!” the angels said to Lot and his family. “Don’t look back, if you do, you may be swept away in the destruction.” \n\nAs soon as they had escaped, fire came from heaven and destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. However, Lot’s wife, turned to look back and when she did, she turned into a tower of salt. Lot and his daughters continued on, running to the hills where they escaped the destruction.\n\n**The Lord rescues all those who trust in him.**"

                        "value": "**A narrative for the young based on the lesson’s text**\n\nThe branches of a giant oak tree swayed in the breeze high above Abraham and his three visitors, as they reclined against its trunk. It had provided abundant shade from the late afternoon sun while the three men finished their meal and rested from their journey. Despite the peaceful atmosphere, Abraham’s excitement had not dissipated since their arrival. Abraham had served a meal, and his guests allowed him to participate in this divine council. Yahweh stood and stretched his arms, signaling the angels, who had accompanied him, that it was time to continue on in their journey. Abraham jumped up and followed them as they set out across the valley, climbing the hill towards the Salt Sea and the city of Sodom. \n\nYahweh stopped when they reached the highest point. As he looked down the Jordan Valley, he looked at the angels and said, “I will share with Abraham what I am about to do, since he shall be the father of a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him. I have chosen him, so that he may instruct his children and household to keep the way of the Lord by trusting me and conforming to my character, which leads to righteousness. Then I may bring to Abraham what I have promised him.” \n\nWithout a response, Yahweh continued, and shared his plans for the cities that lay below them. “I will go down to Sodom and Gomorrah. The outcry against these cities has become great and their sin is very grave, so I will go down and see if they deserve destruction according to the loud protest that has come to me. If the sin is not as grave as I have heard, I will know.”\nAbraham could not hide the shock at this news. The color drained from his face and his legs were sapped of their strength. As he sank to his knees, Yahweh’s two companions bowed to their Lord and then ascended into the valley towards Sodom.\n\nDestruction? What did that entail, thought Abraham? His mind raced as the faces of all his acquaintances flashed before him. Most of all, he thought of his nephew Lot and his family, who lived in Sodom. “Oh Lord, will you really sweep away those who are righteous with those who are wicked? Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you still destroy the city, or will you spare it for the sake of the fifty righteous who dwell there?” He looked up at his Lord’s face and pleaded, “Surely, you would not do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked. You would not give the righteous the same fate as the wicked! Far be it from you! As the judge of all the earth, won’t you do what is just?”\n\nYahweh continued to look out across the valley, focused on the cities bustling beneath them. “If I find fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake,” he answered somberly. \n\nAbraham continued and said, “I, who am but dust and ashes, endeavor to speak to you again, my Lord. What if there are only forty-five righteous people? Will you destroy the whole city for five less than fifty?”\n\n“I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there,” Yahweh replied.\n\nAbraham tried again and asked, “Suppose there are just forty?” \n\n“For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”\n\n“Please, don’t be angry with me if I persist. What if there are thirty there who are righteous?” he asked again.\n\nYahweh continued to grant his request and said, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.”\n\n“And if there are twenty found there?”\n\n“For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it,” the Lord answered.\n\nAbraham breathed a sigh of relief. Surely, there must be twenty righteous in the city, he thought to himself. But what if it was only Lot and his family who worshipped Yahweh? So, once more he pleaded, “Don’t be angry with me for asking, but what if only ten are found?”\n\nYahweh turned to Abraham and looked at him with compassion, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.” Abraham gripped his hand and thanked the Lord, knowing that he would keep his word. There was a brief smile that crossed Yahweh’s face expressing his appreciation for Abraham’s compassion, but as quickly as it came, the smiled faded with the grief of the necessary judgment that was to come. \n\nEvening had come, the sun had fallen behind the hills, casting a glow over the city. Despite their well-traveled appearance, Lot spotted the messengers of the Lord at once. They were no ordinary men. Like pearls amongst sand, the angels stood out amongst the crowd entering the city. He waited at the gate, watching others take notice of them as well. Quick to guard these men of God, Lot greeted them as they entered, bowing himself to the ground, he said, “My lords, please come over to my house. It would be an honor to serve you there. After you spend the night and wash your feet, you may rise up early and go on your way.”\n\n“No,” the angels replied, as they looked past Lot and towards the center of the city. “We will spend the night in the town square,” they explained. They seemed to be inspecting each interaction occurring all around them.\n\n“Please,” Lot pressed. “It would be my honor for you to join me in my home. I can give you a safe and comfortable place to sleep tonight. I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to stay in the city center.” he explained, with a nervous chuckle. By now, more than a few people had gathered, curious about the important strangers. The other leaders who were sitting at the gate with Lot came out to investigate as well. “Who are these friends of yours Lot?” they asked. \n\n“They are guests of mine,” he answered, without taking his eyes from the angels. “That is, if you will come to my home,” he pleaded once more. The angels relented and followed Lot down the street towards his house. When they reached his door, onlookers watched from almost every doorway and corner as Lot’s mysterious guests entered his home. Calling the servants, Lot began to organize a feast. His wife baked unleavened bread while the servants brought olives, cucumber, and yogurt. Lot’s two daughters brought out every delicacy found in Sodom for their honored guests. \n\n“What has brought you to Sodom, my lords?” Lot asked.\n\n“Yahweh has heard your cries, Lot. We have come on behalf of the Lord to see if the sin of this city is truly as great as we have heard,” they explained.\n\nLot’s excitement over his special guests faded as his thoughts turned to the ways of this city. The nature of their visit was unexpected. He had agonized over the evil and violence he saw day after day, but he hadn’t expected such a swift response. “The sin here is grave,” he began, looking distressed. “The sensual conduct I see day after day is not how the Lord designed us. It torments me to see it. I have thought of leaving, but my wife loves this city, and I can’t possibly pull her away from here. Our daughters are soon to be married and my sons-in-law have a prominent place here. I cannot ask them to leave that behind,” Lot explained. “What will the Lord do?”\n\n“Unless there are ten righteous people here, he will destroy this city,” they replied.\n\n“The entire city?” Lot asked, feeling grieved and panicked at the same time. Before the angels could answer, a knock came at the door. It was a knock that sounded less than friendly while loud voices began shouting from behind it.\n\n“Lot! Lot! Where are the men that are staying with you tonight? We demand to see them.” \n\nLot hesitated. “Stay here,” he cautioned the angels. Opening the door slowly, Lot slipped outside to deal with the visitors. Immediately, a strong smell of alcohol reached his nose. When his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he was surprised to see his house surrounded by the men of the city, young and old. He took a step back against the door. He knew their intentions toward the angels was anything but honorable. These men were led by their fleshly desires. \n\n“Bring your guests to us!” they continued shouting at him. \n\n“I ask you, brothers, don’t act so wickedly,” he pleaded. \n\n“Who are you to say we are wicked,” a neighbor of his said, grabbing his arm and holding a knife in his face.\n\nFrantic, Lot said, “Look, I have two daughters who have never been with a man. Let me bring them to you and you may have them instead. Just don’t do anything to my guests. They are in my home under my protection.”\n\n“Stand back!” shouted the man with the knife and then snickered, saying, “Look who is the judge now. It’s the foreigner who doesn’t even belong in this city. Now, we will do worse things to you than we will to them!”\n\nThen, the entire crowd began to press Lot against the door until he could scarcely breathe, trying to break it down. Suddenly, the angels grabbed Lot, dragging him into the house with them and shut the door. Lot collapsed on the floor, waiting for the men to force themselves into the house. The pounding continued for a moment, but instead of increasing it began to fade. Lot heard whimpering and wailing. “I can’t see!” someone called out. “I’m blind! It’s a curse!” yelled another. The pounding at the door became scratching, that caused their spines to tingle, as men drug their fingernails across the door. The crowd groped their way around in the darkness until they eventually dissipated and found their way home.\n\n“Did you blind them?” Lot asked the angels. They gave a quick nod and began to speak with urgency.\n\n“We have come to rescue you. Is there anyone else here besides your wife and daughters?” they asked. “What about your daughter’s future husbands? Are they in the city? You must go from this place. Bring them with you and flee, since we are about to destroy this place. The outcry from the victims of this city has become too great. So, the Lord has sent us to put an end to Sodom.”\n\nMotionless, Lot remained crouched on the floor, unable to comprehend the angels warning. His head hung low and his heart pounded. Now? He had to escape, tonight? Could this really be happening, he asked himself. The sound of sniffling came from the corner of the room where his wife and daughters stood huddled together, traumatized after the attempted home invasion. \nLot looked over at them, wondering how he was going to convince them to leave. Then, under each shoulder came two muscular arms, as the angels lifted Lot to his feet.\n\n“Prepare your mind for action, man. You must go, now!” they said to him. Lot looked up at them and nodded.\n\n“Get ready, Zillah,” Lot ordered his wife.  Zillah, a little surprised at Lot’s tone, grabbed her daughters and ran to the kitchen collecting food and supplies. Generally soft spoken, Lot had never ordered her to do anything. Feeling irritated at her lack of control over the situation, she barked out orders to her daughters as they sorted out items of the highest priority.\n\nMeanwhile, Lot slipped out of the house and ran to his sons-in-law. “Dedan! Sidon!” he shouted as he pounded on the door. “Hurry, we must get out of here!” After what seemed to be an eternity, the door opened. In front of Lot stood his soon to be son-in-law, Sidon. \n\n“What are you going on about, Father?” he asked, slurring his words slightly as he rocked back forth in the door frame. “Is this some kind of joke?”\n\nLot pushed past him and walked into the house where Dedan, his other son-in-law, sat with some friends and a few scantily clad women. “Dedan! Get your things, we must go now!” Lot pleaded. \n\n“Seriously? Is this a joke? Surely, I am not going to leave Sodom in the middle of the night,” Dedan chuckled.\n\n“Messengers of the Lord have warned me that Sodom will be destroyed. They are here to rescue us,” Lot explained.\n\nDedan smirked and looked at his father-in-law in disbelief. “This must be a joke,” he said. \n\nSo, Lot turned to Sidon who had collapsed into a chair, dozing off to sleep. Frustrated, he thought of his daughters and headed out the door and back to his house as quickly as he had come. \n\nDiscouraged, Lot collapsed on the floor. His two guests remained at the table where he had left them. “My sons-in-law don’t believe me!” he explained to them, frustrated. \n\n“Get up. You must go!” the angels replied.\n\nHeeding their command, Lot got to his feet searching the house for his wife. He found Zillah in the back room franticly stuffing her favorite robes and jewels into a sack. \n\n“Zillah, we must go now,” Lot pleaded.\n\n“Don’t tell me what to do,” she shouted at him. “I am not ready yet.” \n\nLot turned and left the room, looking for his daughters. “Where is Dedan and Sidon?” they asked him. “Are they coming with us?” \n\n“No, they didn’t believe me,” he explained. \n\n“What!? Will you bring us back to them? How will we ever be married?” his eldest asked. “You can’t do this to us,” she screamed, bursting into tears. Lot left his daughters to morn and went back to sit with the angels, clearly defeated at his family’s hesitancy to heed the Lord’s warning. It wasn’t long before the room began to brighten with the dawn. \n\n“Alright, enough lingering. Get up, take your wife and your daughters and go or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city!” the angel commanded.\n\n“I understand, but they are not ready to go yet.” Lot pleaded. \n\nAt that, the angels disappeared to the back rooms and reappeared, dragging Zillah and her daughters behind them. Then they took Lot by the hand as well, leaving their possessions behind and drew them straight out the city gate and toward the hills. Leaving them to go on alone, one of the angels said, “Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Run to the hills so you are not swept away with the destruction.”\n\n“Oh no, please my lords, you have been so good to me and have shown me great kindness in saving my life, but I cannot escape to the hills. It’s too dangerous, we may die all alone there,” Lot said, his voice trembling. “Please, can we go to the small city of Zoar? It’s not too far and we can survive there,” he suggested.\n\nThe angel looked across the valley towards Zoar and nodded. “I grant you this favor as well. I will not destroy that city. But go quickly, for I cannot carry out the Lord’s command until you arrive there.”\n\nThe sun had fully risen when they stumbled up to the gate of Zoar. As they entered, a white light flashed from above, blinding them for a moment. Screams sounded throughout the city while Lot searched for a place to hide. The last thing he heard was the sound of a giant explosion before his eardrums were blown out. Lot threw himself over his daughters, protecting them from debris, as they clasped their hands over their ears to keep out the ringing. Then, the ground began to tremble. Fearful and unsure of where to hide, Lot stood and ran to the top of the city wall to try and see what was happening. What he saw forced him to his knees. A massive hole lay in the earth while balls of fire fell from the sky, creating more flashes of light. Lot rushed back to his wife and daughters as the ground continued to shake. \n\n“It’s not safe here,” he shouted over the ringing in his ears. “We are too close.” Lot grabbed his daughters by the hand and ran from the city towards the hills. When they reached a high point, Zillah stopped and looked at the devastation caused by the stones falling from the sky. Smoke had darkened the morning light, but through it, she could see her home still standing on the edge of the abyss. “It’s still there!” she shouted with joy. “Sodom is still there! We can go home. It will be safe now.”\n\n“No, Zillah! You must not look back!” Lot begged her. “It will be destroyed!” \n\nBut his wife refused to listen. She began barreling down the hill into the valley. Lot shuddered as the entire valley began to shake while the open bitumen pits began to catch fire and explode as gas released from the earth. Caught among the explosions, Zillah got blasted with the sulfur and minerals escaping the earth, fixing her to the ground in a pillar of salt. Almost completely hidden in the smoke, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah began to slide while the earth collapsed around the hole. Tears rolled down Lot’s face, his daughters wailing in grief at the loss of their mother, while they continued to watch the annihilation of everything living beneath them. \n\nTrembling in fear, Lot remained with his daughters in the hills. Days later, they begged him to return to Zoar, since it had remained intact, but Lot remained unsure of its safety. Finally, when he could no longer stand the smell of sulfur and smoke, Lot led his daughters to a cave where they could make a home. Despite his daughters hopes, he knew they could never return to the Jordan Valley. The land was no longer fruitful, and the crater left from the meteor had begun to fill with water, but not clean water. The water was surely full of salt and other minerals, rendering it useless. Life was miserable in the cave. He could barely feed his daughters, for everything he owned had been destroyed in Sodom. The misery finally broke him when he discovered that both of his daughters were pregnant. Misery turned to deep shame and guilt when his daughters revealed to him that they had become pregnant by getting him drunk and laying with him. \n\nWhen it came time to name his firstborn son, Lot lifted him up and through eyes burning with tears, he named him Moab, which meant from father. The moment was nothing like what he had imagined at the birth of a son or even a grandson. His tears were not tears of joy, but tears shed from the torment of his soul over the sin that had followed him out of the wicked city of Sodom.\n\n**Despite Lot’s hold on the world, the Lord rescued him from destruction because he was righteous. The Lord rescue’s all those who trust in him from the coming judgement of sin.**\n\t",

He was headed down into the valley to join his friend Hirah and shepherd his flocks among the Canaanites. Judah's newfound freedom made each step feel lighter than the one before it. Jacob's suffering over the loss of Joseph was more than Judah could bear. Watching his father grieve day in and day out only made the burden of guilt seem heavier. The heavier it got, the more he wanted to run away from his family and everything that reminded him of Joseph. The favor that Judah was once so envious of had lost its luster. What Judah thought he could gain from Joseph's disappearance was now tainted with his blood. So, his interest in inheriting his father's blessing was no longer something he desired. The shame over what he had done to his own brother had taken its toll and left him no other choice in his own mind than to leave everything and everyone behind. \n\n\"Welcome, my friend!\" Hirah said, throwing his arm around Judah's shoulder. Judah smiled broadly at his friend. Hirah's warm and unrestrained personality always seemed to help ease the burden of guilt he carried. \"Let's give your sheep some water and head into Adullam to find some entertainment,\" Hirah said with a wink. \nJudah laughed, \"You sure do know how to have fun.”\n\nThat night and many nights after, Judah and Hirah drank too much wine and met too many Canaanite women. It was an easy distraction for Judah and kept his mind from wandering back to his family. The one thing it didn't do was fill the emptiness inside him. Despite his distractions, his flocks multiplied, and his prominence amongst the Canaanite people. Although it did not bring the peace, he longed for.\n\nOne day, Judah, while doing business with a man called Shua, Judah caught sight of Shua's daughter. One look at this mysterious woman, and he convinced himself he had to have her. However, Jacob knew that taking this Canaanite to be his wife would put him even further from his family. Memories of his father instructing him and his brothers not to marry Canaanite women surfaced, but he quickly shoved them aside. By the end of his business meeting, he had asked Shua for his daughter, Mehetabel, and paid the bride price. \n\nA temporary peace settled in Judah's heart in the early years with Mehetabel. She quickly bore him two sons, Er and Onan. Eventually, they moved to Chezib and dwelled near Mehetabel's father, Shua. Shua taught Judah's sons all about the worship of the Canaanite gods, Baal and Asherah. As well as the abundant harvests that came from the fertility festivals. Then, Mehetabel gave birth to a third son named Shelah. \n\nWhen Er had grown, Judah went to a prominent friend of Shua's who had a granddaughter named Tamar. He chose her to be Er's wife, but it was not a happy marriage from the beginning. So consumed by wickedness, Er spent little time at home. Judah sensed that his son treated Tamar more as a slave than a wife. When Er was away, Judah told Tamar stories of his father and the God he served. Much of it was painful to recount, but Tamar was curious, and it was hard to resist her innocent questions. Their friendly conversations were interrupted when Er's servant returned with his coat covered in blood one day. \n\n\"He was devoured by a lion,\" the servant explained to Judah.\nSpeechless, Judah stood motionless, with the coat in his arms. He could not escape the memory of his father grasping a similar coat belonging to Joseph. He began to weep, not only for the death of his own son but also for the tremendous grief he had caused his own father. \n\nWhen Judah finally faced the reality that his son was gone forever, he spoke to Tamar. \"Your time with Er was short; therefore, you have no children to carry on the inheritance. It is the custom that I give you to Er's brother, Onan, as a wife. Then he can raise up children for his brother.”\n\nTamar had an ever-growing desire to learn more about Judah's heritage. She had an unexplainable interest in knowing about this God named, Yahweh whom Judah's father served. So, when Judah gave her to Onan, she was desperate for children to secure her place in the family. Tamar assumed Onan would be different from Er. He had always been friendly towards her. Even treating her with more respect than her first husband. However, as time went on, the brothers were not so different. Onan refused to give her children. He had no desire to raise children who would ultimately be given his older brother's inheritance. He wanted the inheritance for himself. Just like Er, Onan spent most of his time away. Once again, Judah found himself sitting around the fire telling his daughter-in-law the stories of his family. \"Tell me the story of Bethel again,\" she would plead. Or she would ask him what Paddam Aram was like. Sometimes her questions brought up memories of Shechem or his brother Joseph, and he would fall quiet and tell her to go get her work done. But Tamar always returned the next day asking about Yahweh and his promise to Judah's father.\n\nYears had passed, and Onan had still not given Tamar a child. Then tragedy struck again when Onan was killed in a hunting accident. This time Judah's reaction was different. He looked grieved but scared at the same time. \n\"What is happening? How could I lose two sons, and neither of them has given me an heir?\" he thought to himself, \"this woman is a curse to my family.\" After Judah buried Onan, he told Tamar, \"My youngest son is not yet old enough to marry. You should go and live in your father's house until he is old enough.\" In his heart, he knew he could not lose another son. Until he could figure out a way to free Shelah from this marriage, he would do what he could to keep Tamar away from him. \n\nHeartbroken, Tamar packed her things and returned to her father's house. She waited and waited, longing to be brought back into Judah's family, but he never came for her.\n\n1. **Judah left his brothers and moved away. Which group of people did he live amongst?** Judah lived among the Canaanite people.\n2. **Who did Judah take as a wife? What did the Lord think of his actions?** Judah took a Canaanite woman to be his wife. The Lord had told Abraham and Isaac not to marry those women, so it wasn't a good idea for Judah as well.\n3. **In Genesis 49:10, we read ahead to see Jacob blesses Judah as his heir before he dies. Judah will also be the tribe to rule over the nation of Israel. If this was God's plan for him, in what way had Judah wandered so far away from these plans?** Judah went to live among the Canaanites, who lived and worshiped completely opposite of Yahweh and his ways. His Canaanite children would not have followed the paths of God, and the tribe of Judah would have been corrupted from the beginning. \n\n----------\n\n\n**Day 2- Genesis 38:12-19**\n\nYears had passed, and Judah had all but forgotten about Tamar. Not long after she had gone, his wife Mehetabel had become ill. Years had gone by as she suffered and sought healing from the priests of Baal, but nothing they did would bring her relief. In the meantime, his son Shelah had grown up, but Judah had no intention of giving Tamar to him as a wife. Besides, Shelah was content to be with the women serving Baal under the sacred tree like his brothers. \n\nEventually, Mehetabel died, and Judah mourned once again. \"How could I lose two sons and now a wife? Is my family cursed?\" he said to himself. \n\nHis friend, Hirah visited Judah weekly, attempting to comfort him. One morning, Hirah arrived and said in his usual jolly tone, \"Pack your things, Judah. It's time you got out and had some fun. We go up to Timnah to see the sheepshearers and join in the festivities. I heard the wine this year is going to be excellent! It will be great fun.”\n\nSo, Judah dressed in his best robes, tied the cord around his neck that held his signet, and picked up his staff. His days of mourning were over, he decided as he adjusted the cord that held one of his most important possessions. During his grief, he had left the precious signet next to his bed. It felt good to have it around his neck once more, identifying his prominent position amongst the Canaanites. He looked at his staff as well, rubbing his thumb over the familiar etchings. A symbol of his authority, he never went anywhere without it. \n\nAs Hirah and Judah rode out of the city that day, Tamar's mother happened to be near the city gate. When she saw Judah, her daughter's estranged father-in-law, headed to shear his sheep, she went to her quickly with the news. \n\"Tamar, this is your chance,\" her mother said. \"Your chance to get a husband and be taken care of. When your father dies, you will not survive here. Judah has no intention of giving you to Shelah. You've waited long enough. You must take matters into your own hands. Follow Judah to Timnah; many women will be there who work in the temple; you can dress as one of them and deceive him into making you his wife.”\n\nTamar stood before her mother, dressed in the typical clothing meant for widows. The garments were dreary-looking years ago when she had begun to wear them after the death of her first husband. Now they seemed barely fit for a slave. As Tamar looked down at her attire that had complimented her despair so well over the years, a flicker of hope began to grow within her. It had almost been snuffed out when it was clear that Judah no longer wanted her in the family. However, she had worn her widow's clothing every day, desperate to be a part of her father-in-law's clan. It was his God, Yahweh, who drew her. She wanted to secure her place among his people.\n\n\"Yes, Mother, I will go. But it's not just about getting a husband and tricking him into giving me a child. I want my place in Judah's family and for my future children as well,\" Tamar explained.\n\"Well, you must hurry then!\" \n\nTamar removed her dingy clothes and wrapped herself in the clothing fit for a temple woman. Then she headed out of the city as quickly as she could, crossing the valley to get ahead of Judah and his companions. Finally, she arrived at the entrance to Enaim along the road to Timnah. Finding a stone to sit upon, Tamar covered herself with a veil to disguise her face and sat outside the city's gate.\n\nIt wasn't long before Judah, and his friend came along. Tamar caught his attention, and Judah was immediately drawn to her.\n\n\"Go on ahead, Hirah. I will meet you later,\" he told his friend.\nWhen Hirah had gone, Judah said to Tamar, \"I would like to have you.\"\n\"What can you give me in return?\" she asked him with a hauntingly familiar voice.\n\"I will send you a young goat from my flock when I reach them at Timnah.\"\n\"How do I know you will really send a goat? Give me something of yours to keep until you send the goat. I want a guarantee that you will do as you promise,\" Tamar said to him.\n\"Okay, what should I give you?\" he asked.\n\nTamar looked at the signet dangling from his neck, \"I will take your signet with the cord and your staff. When you send me the goat, I will return them to you,\" she explained.\n\nJudah nodded, lifted his precious signet over his head, and placed it in her hand. The engraving upon it signified his identity and position. He hoped he wasn't making a mistake. Then he passed her his staff. \nAs she set it down next to her, she smiled, pleased that things were going as planned. They spent the evening together, but before the sun rose, Tamar returned home to her widow's clothing and patiently waited to see if her plans had worked.\n\n\n1. **Where was Judah heading with his friend, Hirah, the Adullamite?** Judah and Hirah were going to watch the sheep be sheared. The Canaanite culture typically involved pagan rituals and other festivities that involved temple prostitutes.\n 2. **Why was Tamar so desperate to have a child with Judah?** We don't know Tamar's true motives, but it could be that she was drawn to Judah's God, Yahweh, and his family's reputation. She saw the value in being a part of it. Having a child would solidify her place, providing an heir for Judah.\n3. **Were Judah and Tamar's actions sinful?** Yes, both Judah and Tamar acted out of their desires to get what they wanted. But God took something wicked and used it for his good purposes.\n----------\n\n**Day 3- Genesis 38:20-26**\n\nThe next day, Judah asked Hirah to deliver the goat he had promised, \"I need to get back my signet and staff. Will you bring the goat to the woman who was along the roadside in exchange for the things I pledged?”\n\nHirah agreed, but when he got the entrance of Enaim, she was nowhere to be found. He searched the roadside in and out of town, but there was no sign of her. When he returned to the entrance, he recognized a merchant selling rings for the temple worship. \"Where is the woman who works in the temple? She was here yesterday,\" he asked.\n\n\"You must be mistaken. There has been no woman here who works in the temple,\" he replied. \tConfused, Hirah gave up his search and went back to Judah, who had remained with his sheepshearers. \"I looked everywhere, but I could not find the woman. The men in Enaim said there hadn't been any temple woman around lately. Who was that woman?\" Hirah asked.\n\nJudah looked rattled and said, \"Let's just forget it. Let her keep my signet, cord, and staff as her own. It's not worth getting laughed at. I did what I promised. I sent the young goat, but she wasn't there.\" \n\nJudah decided to put the situation out of his mind. He celebrated the sheepshearing and returned to his home with Hirah when it was finished. Three months had passed when one of Judah's most trusted servants came to him with news of Tamar. \"I heard she that she had been immoral. Then I saw it with my own eyes, my Lord. She is pregnant!\"\n\"What?!\" Judah shouted, standing to his feet. \"How could she bring such shame upon my household?! She was to remain a widow in her father's home. The punishment for her immorality is death. Bring her out and burn her,\" he announced.\n\nJudah had no intention of seeing her sentence carried out. He was simply relieved that he no longer had to worry about his responsibility to give Tamar to his son, Shelah. So, when his servant returned with more news shortly after, he was more than displeased. \n\n\"My Lord, there is something you must see,\" his servant explained, refusing to look him in the eye. Judah followed his servant through the city to capture his daughter-in-law. A crowd had gathered. When they had pushed their way through, before him stood Tamar, dressed in her old shabby widow's clothing, with a belly that had begun to protrude beneath them. But Judah wasn't looking at that; he was focused on what lay in her outstretched arms. \n\n\"She claims that the father of her child is the man to whom these belong,\" his servant said apprehensively. \"Is this your signet and staff, my lord?\" he asked, taking the staff from Tamar's hand and giving it to Judah for inspection.\nJudah looked at it hesitantly, rubbing his thumb over the familiar etchings. His face paled, \"How could this be?\" he asked himself under his breath. Judah looked up into Tamar's stoic eyes. Was she the temple woman by the road? How could he have not recognized her? \n\n\"This is mine,\" he announced, unable to take his eyes from Tamar. She came toward him, and with her wrists still tied, she took the cord of his signet and placed it around his neck. Judah looked down at the cylinder that marked his identity. \n\n\"You promised to give me your son, Shelah,\" Tamar said quietly. \"I only wanted to provide you an heir and remain a part of your family. Your God promised to bless your offspring. I believe him.”\n\nJudah looked at his poor daughter-in-law, finally noticing her old widow's clothes. She had been waiting all this time to be brought back into the family like he had promised. Judah fell to his knees before her, completely ashamed of what he had done to her. \n\n\"She is more righteous than I,\" he explained to the people surrounding him. \"By law, she had the right to marry my son, and I kept her from him.\" Judah no longer cared if the people around him laughed or judged him. He was a broken man. It wasn't only his sin with Tamar that weighed upon him, but the years of guilt he had carried since the slaughter at Shechem and, worst of all, his hatred toward his brother. Suddenly his heart seemed to burst within him, and his tears began to flow. Not only tears of sorrow but tears of repentance. From that moment, he would return to the God of his father. No longer would he run from his family and the promises they had been given. It was Tamar, a simple Canaanite woman, who had taught him how valuable they were.\n\n1. **Why did Tamar take Judah's signet, cord, and staff?** Tamar knew if she became pregnant, it would be the only way to prove that Judah was the father of her child.\n2. **Was Judah sorry for the way he had treated Tamar?** Yes, Judah was humbled by Tamar's desire to hold to what he had promised her. He said, \"she is more righteous than I.\" We know he was genuinely sorry because he turned back to the Lord after that, and his father passed on the blessing to him in Genesis 49:10-12. \n3. **Why did Judah say that Tamar was more righteous than he?** He recognized that Tamar held to the promise that she should be given a chance to produce an heir for the family. \n4. **How far are you willing to go to hold onto what God has promised to those who belong to him?** We should never sin like Tamar did to obtain what God has promised, but we be prepared to strive with him through suffering as he fulfills them.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n**Day 4- Genesis 38:27-30**\n\nJudah brought Tamar back into his house to live like his daughter-in-law until it was time for her to give birth. When her labor came, Judah waited and waited for the news of his child. When the midwife finally came to him with information, she said, \"Well, you have not one, but two sons. Tamar was carrying twins. Your second son is quite a fighter. The first stuck his hand out as he was about to come out, and I quickly tied a cord around his wrist to recognize him, but then his brother overtook him and came out first.”\n\nThe events of his son's birth reminded Judah of the story his grandfather, Isaac, used to tell him. His uncle, Esau, had been born with his father, Jacob grasping his heel, almost like his two new sons had been born. Even though Jacob was not the firstborn, he fought for his father's blessing and obtained it. Judah kept this in mind and announced their names as Perez and Zerah. \n\n1. **How many sons did Tamar give birth to? Who was the firstborn?** She gave birth to twins. Perez fought through to become the firstborn.\n2. **In Zechariah 10, the Lord promises great things for the tribe of Judah. He promises to make them strong and redeem them. He says that from them will come the cornerstone. Do you know who calls himself the cornerstone?** Jesus is called the cornerstone. He is the stone that the foundation of his church is built upon. Judah and Tamar were the great, great, great,….grandparents of Jesus our Messiah, and he comes from the tribe of Judah.\n3. **The Lord took a man running from him and lost in sin and a woman from a family who worshipped idols to begin the story of his people? What does that tell you about Yahweh?** The Lord takes our brokenness and sin and uses them to make everything work towards his plans and purposes. It shows us how merciful and loving he is towards us. It's comforting to know that his plans don't depend on us, he is the one in control, and we can trust that.\n \n\n*The Lord used Judah and Tamar to demonstrate how firm his promises are. Despite their sin, God used them to carry on the promises to Israel, and from them came the Savior of the world.*    \n\n\n\n\n"

He stooped down; he crouched as a lion and as a lioness; who dares rouse him? The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until tribute comes to him; and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples. **”**\n\n----------\n\n\n**Genesis 38:1-11 – Life away from God is full of sin and death**\n\n*Pastoral Notes:* The end of chapter thirty-seven leaves the story of Joseph hanging in suspense. We left simply knowing Joseph had been sold to a man named Potiphar. Now the narrative quickly shifts focus onto Judah. Since Joseph is out of the picture, and Jacob's three older sons had sinned against their father, the inheritance fell to Judah. However, it would seem that Judah showed no interest in being the recipient of God's blessing. His move away from his father, and his marriage to a Canaanite woman, was clear evidence that Judah was trying to cut ties with his family and responsibility. The story we read in Chapter thirty-eight runs parallel to the chapters about Joseph that will follow. The two stories merge again in chapter forty-two. \n\nThe story of Judah is not just about his geographical move away from his father's house. It also highlights the sinfulness of his actions to integrate into Canaanite culture and religion. He raises three sons and even finds a Canaanite wife for Er, his eldest son. After the Lord killed Er for being wicked, Jacob commands his second eldest to take his brother's wife. In ancient times, when a husband died before having children, it became the responsibility of a brother of the deceased to marry his brother's wife and have a child in the brother's name. The practice was known as levirate marriage. [1] However, Judah's second son Onan was not interested in propagating his brother's name. It would seem he would rather have a more significant portion of his father's inheritance for himself. After the Lord killed Onan, Judah superstitiously casts the blame onto his daughter-in-law, Tamar. Instead of keeping her in his home until his third eldest was old enough to marry, he sent her back to her father to live.\n\n1. What do you think motivated Judah to leave his father's house?\n2. What words and phrases repeat to help frame the theme of this section?\n3. What are some implications in this story for living outside the will and blessings of God?\n\n----------\n\n\n**Genesis 38: 12-30 - God shows Judah mercy**\n\n*Pastoral Notes:* The death of Judah's wife marks a pivot in the story, bringing Tamar into a leading role. After a few years, Tamar realizes she is waiting in vain for Judah's youngest son to reach manhood, and decides to take matters into her own hands. Tamar knew what kind of man Judah was and how she could deceive him into sleeping with her. Because Tamar knew that he went to the city to participate in pagan rituals and festivities, she was able to dress up like a temple prostitute and trick him into lying with her. Tamar showed herself to be just as deceptive. Similar to the story of Jacob tricking his father Isaac into giving him the blessing, Tamar also disguises and misleads to get what she wants. Not only was she successful in getting pregnant, but she also acquired three valuable items that would identify Judah as the father. In ancient times, a man's signet ring, staff, and robe were just as good as a modern DNA test. When Judah realized what he had fallen for, he withheld from killing Tamar. It is quite a stretch for us to think that a girl who deceived her father-in-law is called \"righteous.\" Yet, it is essential to see that Judah compared her actions to his own. Because he was more guilty than she was, he could not condemn her and his children to death for the sins in which he was also complicit. His only way out was to acknowledge his sin and humbly take Tamar as his wife. \n\nThe story of Judah moves quickly through time. The first 11 verses cover about 20 years. Then time slows down to the last year, before this narrative comes to an end. The final three verses cover only a few hours and focus on the story of the birth of Perez and Zerah. The detail of their birth draws us back to another account of twins being born. Perez means \"Breach\" or \"to push through.\" Born of prostitution and incest to the Canaanite woman Tamar, this son nevertheless came into the messianic line.\n\n1. What words and phrases shape the theme of this section of the passage?\n2. How do Judah's actions seem to pose a threat to the promises of God?\n3. Has there been a time when you have realized that God's mercy has kept you from the consequences of your sin?\n\n----------\n\n**Genesis 49: 8-12– God chose the line of Judah**\n\n*Pastoral Notes:* The final chapters of Genesis are about Jacob and his descendants. We fast forward now to the end of Jacob's life just before he dies. In this passage, we see clearly why the narrative of Judah is where it is. Before Jacob dies, he blesses each of his sons, with Judah and Joseph receiving the most attention. The blessings portray the future history of each of Jacob's sons. In verses eight to twelve, we see Judah receiving the sign of the lion and the lions' share of the blessing. In this passage, Jacob declares the national prominence and kingship to Judah's line. Both King David and King Solomon come from Judah's line, and so will the ultimate King, \"to whom the scepter belongs.\" The name \"Shiloh\" is the cryptogram for the Messiah, the one who is also called the \"Lion of Judah.\"[3] There will be so much abundance that people will tie a donkey to a choice vine, letting it eat because there is such abundance. Wine will be as plentiful as water, and everyone will be healthy. Although there are short moments of fruitful bounty in Israel's history, the language in this text points to a future of permanent blessing and abundance.\n\n\n1. What words and phrases in this passage stand out to you?\n2. What contrasts Jacob's blessing of Judah and the story in chapter thirty-eight?\n3. When you consider the story and future of Judah, what reflections do you have about God?\n\n----------\n\n\n**Zechariah 10 – The one for whom God's people wait is Jesus Christ.**\n\n*Pastoral Notes:* The overarching story of Israel is one of constant disobedience and failure to obey God's commands. Parallel to this is the steadfast love of God working to fulfil his promises. In this passage, Zechariah is writing to encourage God's people by reminding them of what God has promised them. In Zechariah's day God's people were also undeserving of all that God was promising them, just as Judah was unworthy of the blessings he received through his father.  \n\nZechariah was a priest who, a as young man coming out of captivity, travelled back to Jerusalem to help rebuild the Temple. The kingdom of Judah was conquered by the Babylonian kingdom and sent into exile around 586BC. In 538, Cyrus the Persian King allowed the captives to resettle in their homeland. About 50,000 people returned to the land and began to rebuild the Temple.[4] However, after a short while, neighbouring opposition, followed by indifference, left the project abandoned and unfinished. Sixteen years later, the Lord called Zechariah and Haggai to stir the people to rebuild the Temple. As a result, the Temple was completed four years later, in 516 B.C.\n\nIn this passage, Zechariah calls on God’s people to request a blessing from God based on His promises. He wants to encourage the people to finish the Temple, reminding them that God will strengthen and establish Israel. This promise rests on the \"cornerstone,\" another name used to describe Messiah. Christ is the foundation on which His kingdom rests and through whom the promises to Israel will be fulfilled.  In verse five, the prophet pictures foot soldiers overpowering the cavalry in battle. This analogy illustrates the power of God's people when He is with them. This would have been an encouraging reminder for a nation in ruins and still under the boot of a foreign king.\n\n\n1.

As he enters the promised land, an army of Angels meets Jacob at the river’s edge. The presence of God’s angels was a reminder of Bethel and God’s promises. God was going to protect Jacob. However, when Jacob learns that his brother is coming with 400 men, he quickly defaults to fear and begins to scheme a plan to defend himself. This passage of scripture is a mix of faith and fear, dependence on God, and dependence on self. At the center of this tension is Jacob’s prayer. Jacob is struggling with two realities; God’s promises represented by the presence of God’s angels and the news of his brother coming to him with an army. In response, Jacob confesses his fear and yet exercises faith. Within his prayer, Jacob reveals his desperation before God. Jacob proclaims God’s promises yet fears for his life. He expresses his unworthiness for what God has given him and is unsure if God will continue to protect him. Jacob’s prayer is a reminder that God uses trials to perfect faith. It is an example that Jacob’s faith was still a work in progress.\n\n\n1. Up to this point, how has God fulfilled his promise to Jacob?\n2. In what areas of his life is Jacob still lacking faith in God?\n3. How do your prayers reveal where you need to grow in faith?\n\n\n**Gen. 32:22–32 – Self-sufficiency is incompatible with the work of God.**\n\nAfter Jacob leads his family across the river for the night, he returns to seek the Lord alone in prayer. Instead of a quiet evening in solitude and prayer, Jacob wrestles all night with “a man.” The story of Jacob wrestling with God leaves much to the imagination. Many details are left unsaid that leaves us to ponder the nature of this battle. However, what is clear is that Jacob wrestled all night with a man who Jacob at some point realizes is God. After Jacob is worn down and wounded, he uses his last bit of strength to cling to his opponent and beg for a blessing. God took the initiative to wrestle with Jacob because God was bringing Jacob to the end of himself.\nJacob was learning that if he was going to receive God’s blessing, he must completely submit to God’s work in his life. Now with his hip out of joint, Jacob’s strategy changes. With all of his might, Jacob clings to God and pleads for God’s blessing. Jacob’s persistence in clinging to God reveals the sincerity of his felt need for God.\nIn response to Jacob’s prayer, God gives him a new name. The name change is significant because Jacob’s name represented his nature and his relationship with God. The name “Jacob” described his past life riddled with sin, conflict, and dishonor. Jacob’s new name, “Israel,” means “God strives” or “he who strives with God.” This name described Jacob’s persistence in pursuing God, as well as the promise of God’s presence and protection.\n\n1. How is God shaping Jacob’s faith through this wrestling match?\n2. What does God’s willingness to wrestle with Jacob all night say about God?\n3. Has there been a time in your life that you sought the Lord in fervent prayer?\n\n**Genesis 33 – Only God can bring about a change of heart.**\n\nThis chapter is clear evidence that actual change can only come when God changes the hearts of sinful people. Now in his nineties, Jacob comes face to face with his brother once more, prepared to face him the way he always had. After lining up his family from oldest to youngest, Jacob waits to greet his brother at the parade’s end. Instead of exacting Justice, Esau falls to the ground with Jacob and hugs him. Through the power of God, the two brothers experience forgiveness and restoration. Jacob’s feeble attempt to bribe Esau with his gift played no part in their reconciliation. However, instead of receiving the gift back, Jacob insists on his brother keeping it. The motive, however, of Jacob’s generosity has changed dramatically. Through Jacob’s encounter with God and seeing the transforming work of God in the face of his brother Esau, Jacob gives the gift as an act of worship. Perhaps this acts as the first tithe that Jacob promised to God in obedience to the vow he made in Bethel twenty years earlier. This reconciled relationship is a testimony to Jacob and his descendants of how change can only come about through the power of God. Jacob experienced a changed heart before God and the power of God to change the heart of his brother Esau as well. Now Jacob can settle in the land in peace, receiving the blessings of God’s promises.\n\n1. How does this passage testify to God’s provision for Jacob?\n2. What did God have to do to reconcile Jacob and Esau?\n3. Was there a time when God changed your heart towards someone to experience reconciliation?\n\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n\n**Philippians 3:1–16 – Self-sufficiency is contrary to unyielding faith and prayer**\n\n*Pastoral Notes:* Despite his crippling wound, Jacob overcame God. He did not overcome through the power of his flesh but with unyielding faith and prayer. In Philippians chapter three, Paul lists how he tried to obtain God’s blessing through works of the flesh. Similarly, Paul encounters God and is brought to his knees through the revelation of Christ on the road to Damascus. Paul teaches that, like Jacob, faith in God causes a change of heart and a change of action.\n We move from a life that pursues our own preservation to a passionate pursuit of Christ and his kingdom.\n\n1. What is Paul’s list of accomplishments in the flesh?\n2. How do verses 14 to 16 teach us how to “press on” or “strive” to know Jesus without putting confidence in the flesh?\n3. What are the things you put confidence in that God calls you to “put to death”?\n\n$$$$$$$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

They had parted, not on friendly terms, but at least in agreement not to seek vengeance. Returning home was something Jacob had longed for, ever since he had left in haste to escape his brother’s wrath. His relief, however, was short-lived as he began to plan the inevitable reunion with Esau. \n\nLeading his company of wives, children, servants, and livestock, Jacob approached the Jabbok River, nearing the border to the land of Canaan. Straining his eyes to see the river below him, he caught sight of two large men crossing the river and headed towards him in full armor. Jacob stiffened. Raising his hand, he signaled his large party to halt. As the men drew closer, Jacob quickly came to realize that these were not men at all! They were the angels from his dream at Bethel so many years ago. Looking beyond to the other side of the river, he realized they were not the only angles there. He could see God’s camp, occupied with hundreds of angels ready for battle. \n\n“It’s God’s camp,” he shouted, unable to contain his excitement. Rachel looked at him, a bit puzzled by his outburst. “Don’t you see them?” he asked her. She just shrugged her shoulders, but behind her stood Leah, amazed by the scene around her. Thousands of angels patrolled the camp, standing tall and majestic, stretching far and wide, over rocky hillsides and along the banks of the Jabbok, armed with swords at their waist and breastplates of gold. Over the sound of the river. Although he could not hear the words, he could listen to the tune and the voices carrying above the water. Jacob turned to see the reactions of his family. Everyone was moving about like it was any typical day.  Most had begun to set up camp, oblivious to the splendor and majesty of their neighbors. However, when he turned back toward the angels, they were gone. Like waking from a dream, the sight that Jacob had previously seen across the river had vanished. \n\n“I will call this place “Mahanaim,” for there are two camps here, our camp and God’s camp,” Jacob proclaimed.\n\nWith renewed strength, Jacob began to prepare himself to meet his brother. Gathering men to go ahead of him as messengers, Jacob explained his plan. “My brother resides in the land of Seir within Edom. Please bring a message to him. Say, ‘To my master Esau: I have sojourned with our uncle Laban for twenty years. I have not returned home until now. I have with me oxen, donkeys, flocks of sheep and goats, and many servants. I have sent this message so you might regard me favorably.’”\n\nThe following day, Jacob could see the messengers coming over the hill. They were returning much sooner than expected. They rushed up to Jacob and began speaking.\n“We delivered your message to Esau,” they said.\n\n“Yes, and how did he answer?” Jacob asked anxiously.\n\n“He said to tell you that he is coming to meet you.”\n\n“What was his reaction? Did he seem angry?” Jacob asked them. \n\n“It was hard to tell, Master,” they explained. The men paused for a moment and looked at one another.\n\n“What are you not telling me?” Jacob asked impatiently. \n\n“Master, as we were leaving, we watched him gather around four hundred men to accompany him,” his messenger explained.\n\nJacob’s heart began to pound. His palms began to sweat. “He is seeking vengeance,” Jacob said, sounding defeated. “I surely deserve it. I am the one who deceived our father and stole the blessing that belonged to Esau. The last time I saw him, my brother vowed to kill me. Now he will certainly finish the job.” Jacob took a handful of his hair in both fits and tightened, expressing the fear and distress he felt inside.\n\n“What do I do? What do I do?” he asked himself under his breath as he paced back and forth in his tent. Then he called his head servant and ordered the livestock and servants split into two camps. “If Esau attacks one camp, then at least the other camp can escape,” he explained. But he knew this wasn’t good enough. “What about the children,” he thought. “They could never escape four hundred armed soldiers.”\n\nFear continued to dictate his every thought. Jacob felt completely Jacob helpless. After Jacob spent a few more minutes in thought, he walked to the edge of where he had seen God’s camp. In desperation, he fell to his knees and cried out, “O God of my grandfather Abraham and God of my father, Isaac. I call upon you for help! Yahweh, you told me to return to my homeland and my family to go well with me. I don’t deserve the love and devotion you have shown me. I am so unworthy of it, yet your love and faithfulness are there for me no matter what I do. I am your servant, for I crossed this river twenty years ago with only my staff, but now because of your blessing, I have returned with enough for two camps! Now, I humbly ask you to protect me from my brother, Esau. I am so scared that he will come and attack me and my wives and children. You promised me that you would do me good and make my children number the sand of the sea. Please don’t let harm come to my children and me.\n\nJacob stood, wiping the tears from his face and still shaking with emotion. When he entered the main camp, he instructed his servants to send gifts for his brother. “Perhaps I can bless Isaac with a portion of my wealth. Maybe I can appease him by submitting myself to him.” \n\nJacob spoke to his servants, saying, “First, take with you two hundred female goats and twenty male goats. Bring them just shy of Seir so Esau will come upon them on his way here,” he explained. “When Esau asks who you are, say to him, ‘These animals belong to your servant Jacob. They are a present sent for you.” Bringing the message with them, the servants set out right away with their herd of goats. Then he called more of his shepherds and said, “As soon as they leave the camp, gather two hundred ewes and twenty rams to meet Esau along the road and deliver the same message.” After the herd of Ewes and rams left, Jacob continued to send out droves of livestock, camels and calves, cows and bulls, female donkeys, and male donkeys as gifts for his brother. One after the other, leaving space between each, so Esau would come upon each herd as he traveled closer to Jacob.\n\t  \n**Who camped near Jacob?** God’s camp of angels camped next to Jacob’s camp.\n\n**Why was Jacob so fearful of his brother Esau?** Jacob had taken Esau’s birthright and blessing. The last time he saw Esau, his brother wanted to kill him.\n\n**What are some important things you see in the way Jacob prayed to the Lord?** How can your prayers be more like Jacob’s? 1. Jacob spoke God’s promise to him. 2. Jacob humbled himself before God by acknowledging how unworthy he was of anything God gave him. 3. Jacob praises the Lord for the love and faithfulness he has already shown him. 4. Jacob asks for help. 5. Jacob prays in faith by reminding God of the promise he made to him.\n\n**Day 2 - Genesis 32:22-32**\n\nThat night, Jacob tossed and turned in his bed. Haunting visions of Leah and Rachel being captured and his children slaughtered. Eventually, he arose. With the full moon giving light to the entire camp, Jacob woke up his wives.\n\n“Wake up, Rachel,” he said softly. “Gather Leah, Bilhah, Zilpah, and the children. We are leaving. It’s too dangerous here for you.”\n\nJacob waited while they gathered some supplies. Cradling Joseph over his shoulder, Jacob led the four women and eleven children across a bend in the river to a secluded area on the bank covered by brush. After everyone was placed on the other side of the river, Jacob returned to the camp alone, awaiting his brother. \n\nJacob laid down next to the fire, but sleep still evaded him. His mind raced with possibilities of what the morning might bring. Would Esau kill him swiftly or take him captive? Would he take Rachel and Leah for himself? What would happen to the children? He had called on Yahweh for help. Why hadn’t he answered, he thought. He had promised to do him good, yet here he was, alone in the dirt, awaiting his brother to strike him down. “I need your blessing!” Jacob called out again in frustration. “Where are you? You said you would always be with me? Your camp of angels is here. Send them to help me,” Jacob persisted, pounding his fists into the dirt. \n\nSuddenly Jacob heard footsteps and quickly jumped to his feet. Just outside the light of the fire stood a man. Although Jacob could not see his face, he knew it was not someone from his camp. Jacob stood crouched and ready for whatever happened next. Suddenly the man came at him and slammed him to the ground. Jacob quickly tore away from the man’s grip, rolling away from him, regaining his stance. He then countered by grabbing the man by his waist and driving him to the dirt. The man quickly escaped Jacob’s attempt to choke him out. They rolled away from each other and stood for a moment. Jacob was unsure of what was happening, but he was desperate and wondered how God would save him from this foe. On and on, they wrestled through the night. Jacob was relentless and intense. As daybreak came, Jacob finally got the upper hand, wrapping his opponent in a headlock. Suddenly the man reached out and touched Jacob’s hip, and Jacob dropped to the ground screaming in pain. Jacob was broken. Before the man could step away, Jacob grabbed onto his leg with all of his might. As the pain throbbed through his body, a revelation came over him. It was the answer to the riddle he had been trying to solve all evening. “Who is this man who fights me?” Now, broken, desperate, and his power stolen in a single touch, Jacob held on tightly.\n\nThe man finally spoke to him, saying, “ It is time to let me go. The sun is rising.” \n\n“I will not let you go unless you bless me, for I am nothing without you,” Jacob said, clinging to his leg while his hip throbbed in pain. \n\n“What is your name?” the man asked softly.\n\n“Jacob, my name is Jacob.”\n\n“Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, you have made every effort in seeking God to obtain his blessing, and you have succeeded,” the man said to him. \n\nJacob released himself from the man’s leg and rolled onto his back, saying, “Please, what is your name?”. \n\n “Why are you asking my name? “I give you my blessing, Jacob, like I promised.” \n\nUpon hearing these words, the man vanished before his eyes. Suddenly Jacob’s snapped back into its socket, and although he was still in great pain, he was able to move again.  Rising to his knees, he said,  “I will call this place Penuel because I have come face to face with God here” Jacob reached out and found his staff. Pulling himself to his feet, he limped back across the river to join with his family. \n\n**Who did Jacob wrestle with?** Jacob wrestled God, who had appeared to him in the form of a man.\n\n**Why was Jacob wrestling God. What was he looking for?** Jacob was desperate to have God’s blessing. He refused to let go of him until God gave it.\n\n**Have you ever been desperate for God to give you something? Is God pleased when we seek after him like Jacob?** The Lord is pleased when we put all our effort towards him, especially when it’s done in faith. \n\t\n**Day 3 - Genesis 33:1-11**\n\nCrouched over a walking stick, Jacob looked to the south. A cloud of dust hung in the distance. He saw Esau, headed towards him with four hundred men. Breathing deep to calm his nerves, Jacob crossed over the river to gather his wives and children. “What happened?” Rachel asked as he limped towards them with his walking stick. \n\n“God is on our side, so we are going to meet my brother. I will explain the rest later.” Jacob answered gruffly. “I need all of you to follow me. He is arriving.” They crossed back over the river and passed by Penuel. When they stopped, Jacob called to Bilhah and Zilpah, “Bring your children and stand here at the front.” The two servant women came forward and stood bravely facing the army of men approaching. “Leah, bring your children and stand behind them,” Jacob instructed. Finally, he placed his beloved Rachel at the back with Joseph, his youngest son. “You wait here while I go out and meet Esau first.”\n\nJacob hobbled his way south away from the river in the direction of Esau’s approach. When he was close enough to see his face, he began to bow to the ground, humbling himself before his older brother, desperate not to be seen as a threat. But to his surprise, instead of running at him with a sword, Esau ran to him, arms outstretched, ready to embrace him! Esau fell upon Jacob’s neck as he knelt on the ground and kissed him. Reunited, the brothers wept as they embraced one another.\n\n“Who are they?” Esau asked, looking towards the camp.\n\n“Those are my children, given to me so graciously by God.”\n\nBilhah and Zilpah came forward bowing to Esau as they presented Gad, Asher, Dan, and Naphtali. Then Leah bowed, with Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. Finally, Jacob brought Rachel forward, presenting Joseph. \n\n“What a wonderful family you have, Jacob,” Esau said, marveling at his sons.\n\n“They are my joy,” Jacob said, grinning from ear to ear. “God has been good to me.” \n\n“I can see he has been good to you in other areas as well. What’s with the excessive gifts I came across on my way here?” Esau asked, surprised by Jacob’s generosity. \n\n“I wanted to please you, my lord,” Jacob explained.\n\nShaking his head, Esau said, “I have plenty, Brother. Keep what you have for yourself.” \n\n“No, please, my lord,” Jacob interjected. “If you are pleased with me, accept the gift I am offering you. Your acceptance of me as your servant has brought me great joy. It’s like seeing God face to face and experiencing his acceptance. So, please take what I have given you as a blessing because God has given me so much.” Persuaded, Esau nodded in agreement.\n\t  \n**Did God protect Jacob from his brother?** Yes, God changed Esau’s heart towards Jacob. He no longer hated him.\n\n**How did Jacob honor the Lord when Esau saw all his blessings?** Jacob told Esau his wives and his children, and everything that belonged to him came from the generosity of the Lord.\n\n**Why do you think Jacob brought his family out of hiding before Esau arrived?** Perhaps Jacob was no longer afraid for their lives because he had wrestled God for a blessing and obtained it. \n\n**Day 4 - Genesis 33:12-20**\n\nAfter a meal celebrating their reunion, Esau said to Jacob, “Let journey together back to my home in Seir. It will be nice to travel together.”\n\n“Oh, what a nice offer, my Lord, but you know that the children are frail and some of the herds with nursing lambs need special care. If we drive them too hard for one day, they will all die. Please, you go ahead of me, and I will follow behind slowly with the children until we come to Seir,” Jacob suggested.\n\n“At least let me leave you with some of my people to help you with your journey,” Esau offered. \t\n\n“There is no need, my lord,” Jacob replied, still a bit apprehensive to trust Esau. \n\nSo, Esau arose the following day to return to Seir. “See you soon, brother,” he called out, waving goodbye. \n\n“Yes, see you soon, my lord,” Jacob said, even though he had no intention of going to Seir. \n\nEventually, Jacob moved on, but instead of going south to Seir, he traveled west and settled in Succoth. Still, it wasn’t long before they relocated further west to the city of Shechem. Outside the city, Jacob bought some land, placing an altar on it and, using his new name, called it El-Elohe-Israel, God, the God of Israel.\n\t\n**How did Esau want to help Jacob?** He asked if they could travel together back to his home. When Jacob said it was better to stay behind, Esau offered to leave him some people to go with him.\n\n**Did Jacob intend to follow his brother back to Seir?** No, Jacob had plans to establish his family and settle in the land God had instructed him to return to.\n\n**How had God been faithful to Jacob in his return to the land of Canaan?** Jacob had sought God’s blessing, and God promised to give him children, land to live on, and protection. God had blessed Jacob with every one of these things just as he promised.\n\n**Jacob put every effort into seeking the Lord and his blessing, and God gave it. There is a great reward for us when we focus all our passions towards Christ and his kingdom, just like Jacob.**\n"

One opponent tries to dominate the other by pinning him to the ground. It’s different than a fight. Punching, hitting, and kicking are not allowed, but it does involve a lot of grabbing and holding. Jacob gets himself into a wrestling match with a very special opponent.\n\nAfter leaving Laban behind, Jacob finally entered his homeland, but it wasn’t going to be easy coming home. His brother Esau was there. The last time Jacob saw Esau, he wanted to kill him. So, Jacob set up camp and waited for his brother to arrive. Scared of Esau, Jacob prayed to God, asking for his help.\n\nThat night, when Jacob was alone, a man came to wrestle Jacob. They rolled in the dirt trying to pin the other to the ground all night. When the sun began to rise the man saw that Jacob was winning, so the man touched Jacob’s hip and broke it. Then Jacob realized, this was no ordinary man, this was God! \n\n“Let me go,” God said to Jacob. \n\nEven though his hip was in pain, Jacob would not let go of him. “I will not let you go until you bless me,” he said.\n\nGod said, “What is your name?”\n\n“Jacob,” he replied.\n\n“You will now be called Israel, because you have wrestled with God and are blessed,” God said to him.\n\nLater that day, Jacob’s brother Esau arrived. When he saw Jacob, he ran to embrace him. Because of God’s blessing, Esau was happy to see Jacob and no longer angry with him. \n\t\n1. What happened to Jacob as he wrestled with God? God touched Jacob’s hip and broke it.\n2. What did God do for Jacob at the end of their wrestling match? God blessed Jacob because he didn’t give up.\n\n**Jacob put all his effort into seeking God’s blessing and God gave it to him.

                        "value": "**A narrative for the young based on the lesson’s text**\n\nCheers sounded from Sarah’s tent at the birth of her baby boy. Cradling the boy in her arms, Sarah began to laugh and said, “The Lord has given me great joy!” Hagar and the other women surrounding her smiled and joined together to sing a song of praise to Yahweh.\n\nWhen Abraham heard their song from outside the tent, he shouted with joy. After so many years of waiting, the Lord had indeed kept his promise. Almost a year had passed since he and his family had traveled south to the Negeb. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah created a cloud of ash and smoke that was too harsh to live near. In Gerar, he had gone to King Abimelech to pitch their tents on his land, but the king had seen Sarah’s beauty, and so he had foolishly told the king she was his sister. Although that part was genuine, Sarah was his half-sister, but he was afraid Abimelech would kill him if he knew she was his wife. Thankfully, the Lord stepped in and warned the king in a dream that he was a dead man if he did not let Sarah go. Abraham had never considered that Abimelech might be a God-fearing man, so he was surprised when the king swiftly returned Sarah. It was Soon after that Yahweh opened Sarah’s womb and the wombs of every woman in Gerar. \n\nAfter years of waiting, Yahweh had fulfilled his promise. Abraham and Sarah were blessed with a healthy son. A son destined to carry the promise to his father that he would eventually become a great nation.  \n\nEight days had passed, as Abraham held his small son up for all to see and said, “His name is Isaac!” Sarah laughed aloud, unable to hide her smile. \n\n“Yahweh has made me laugh! My husband is one hundred years old, yet I have born him a son! Who would have ever thought this would happen? Everyone who hears of this will laugh,” she proclaimed. Then Abraham carefully took the knife and circumcised his son. Shouts of joy and laughter spread through the camp as Abraham and his family celebrated.\n\nThe years passed as Isaac grew into a boy. The entire household took special care of the long-awaited son of Abraham. That is, all but Ishmael. Jealously towards his younger half-brother grew until he could no longer contain it. Looking for every opportunity to ridicule Isaac, Ishmael’s feelings of inferiority got uglier and uglier until Sarah could take it no longer. \n\n“Hagar and Ishmael must go!” Sarah said to Abraham. “Isaac will be your heir, not Ishmael. Tell her to take her son and leave, please, Abraham.”\n\nAbraham expressed his displeasure over the idea to Sarah, but the Lord intervened. “Listen to Sarah. She is right. It is Isaac who will carry your name from his children to his children’s children. No need to worry about Ishmael; he will become a great nation as well because he is your offspring.”\n\nWaking early the following day with a pain in his chest and a knot in his throat, Abraham took some bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar. “Goodbye, Hagar. Take your son and go out from here. The Lord will bless him,” Abraham said to her sadly. \n\nSo Hagar took Ishmael and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba, but it wasn’t long before the water ran out, and they began to starve. Hearing their cries, the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said, “Fear not, for Yahweh has heard the voice of the boy where he is. Get up and hold fast to him, for I will make him into a great nation.” Suddenly her eyes were opened, and she saw a well of water. God saved them!\n\nGod was with Ishmael as he grew strong in the wilderness, becoming an expert bow hunter. While Ishmael grew into a man, Isaac was growing into a young man as well. His father, Abraham, had remained in Beersheba, making a covenant with King Abimelech in the land of the Philistines. \n\n“Abraham!” Yahweh called out one day. “Here I am, Lord,” he answered. “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and travel to the land of Moriah. You are to offer him as a burnt offering on the mountain I will show you.”\n\nAbraham felt his stomach roll inside of him. He couldn’t bear the thought of losing his beloved son. How could Yahweh’s promise of making Isaac into a great nation be fulfilled? Isaac had not yet married and had no children. There must be another way. Yahweh was faithful to his promises and good in all things. He pondered this for some time until the answer came to him. \n“If I give Isaac as an offering, God will raise him from the dead!” Abraham said aloud. Peace settled over him, knowing that he served and obeyed the everlasting God. Nothing was beyond his reach, not even life itself.\t\n\nThe next day Abraham explained to Isaac that the Lord had commanded them to go and make a burnt offering together. Isaac nodded, pleased to accompany his father in worship. So, Abraham rose early the following day, saddled the donkey, and loaded wood for the offering. Then together, Abraham, his son Isaac and two servants traveled to the land of Moriah. On the third day, when they were near the city of Salem, Abraham looked up and saw the place he was to go. “Stay here with the donkey,” he said to the two servants. “Isaac and I will go up and worship the Lord, and then we will both return to you.” \n\nGathering the wood, Abraham lifted the cumbersome load and gave it to Isaac to carry while he picked up the knife and flintstone to make the fire. As they started up the mountain, Isaac called out, “Father!”\n\n“Yes, my son, I am here.”\n\n“We have the wood and the fire starter, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” he asked.\n\n“God will provide for Himself the lamb for the offering, my son.” Isaac nodded, but it continued to weigh heavy upon him that they had nothing to offer the Lord. The higher they climbed, the greater the burden became. Finally, they came to the place Yahweh had chosen. Abraham was silent as he put the wood in place, afraid that if he spoke, he would burst out in grief at the thought of Isaac laid out on the wood. Isaac stepped towards the pile of wood and asked again, “Where is the lamb, Father?”\n\nSpeechless, Abraham took Isaac’s hand gently and bound Isaac’s wrist to the other. “But Father…am I to be the sacrifice?” Isaac asked.\n\n“Yahweh has commanded me to offer you, my only son, as the burnt offering,” Abraham tried to explain. \n\nIsaac was visibly shaken upon hearing the news, but following in his father’s footsteps, his faith remained strong as he considered it a worthy cause to lay his life down for the Lord. Isaac walked to the pile of wood then Abraham helped him lay upon it. Surrendered to his father’s will, Isaac closed his eyes while Abraham raised the knife to slay his son. “Abraham, Abraham!” a voice called from heaven. Hovered over Isaac, Abraham froze and said, “Here I am.” \n\nThen the angel of the Lord said, “Do not lay your hand on your son or do anything to him. For now, I know that you fear God because you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”\n\nAbraham let out a cry of relief, pulled Isaac from the wood, and embraced him. As he looked up, he spotted a ram caught by his horns in the bushes behind him. Taking the ram, Abraham laid it upon the wood and offered it to the Lord instead of his son. Turning to Isaac, he said, “This place will now be called “Yahweh will provide.””\n\nAs they stood upon the mountain, the angel of Lord called a second time and said, “Because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, I will surely bless you, and I will multiply your offspring to number the stars of heaven and the sand of the seashore. All the nations of the earth will be blessed because you have obeyed my voice.”\n\nAfterward, Abraham and Isaac returned to the young servants, just as he had promised. Together, they traveled back to Beersheba, where Isaac dwelled with his mother and father until Sarah died.\n\n**Abraham’s ultimate act of faith was to offer God his most beloved possession.

                        "value": "*Lesson Principle:*     \nGod fulfills his promise as he perfects our faith.\n\n\n----------\n\n**Genesis 20; 21:22-34– God builds our faith to prepare us for his blessings.**\n\nIn Genesis chapter twenty, Abraham's trust in God's promises falters, and he moves from acting in faith to acting in safety.  The same lie that Abraham and Sarah told in Egypt of calling Sarah his sister (a half-truth) is done again when he enters Abimelech's territory. Once again, God had to intervene, showing himself faithful to his promises even when Abraham's faith was weak. If it was not for God, Abraham would have defaulted on his call to be a \"blessing to the nations\" and would have become a \"curse to the nations.\" After God saves Abraham and Sarah from their sin, he promises to give them a child through Sarah. It seems God knew that they still had one more lesson to learn before they were ready to be the recipients of this blessing.  After the birth of Isaac, Abraham had one more dealing with Abimelech. Here we see a covenant made between these two leaders.\n\nIn the same way, God made his covenant with Abraham, Abraham and Abimelech walked between the sacrificial animals. The passing between the animals proclaimed that what happened to these animals would happen to them should they break their promise. Abraham then takes it a step further by giving 7 valuable ewe lambs as a living testimony and promises that Abimelech would guard his promise made to him. It seems with humankind, as with God, relationships are based upon trust to keep promises. \n\n1. What does the story of Abraham and Abimelech teach us about grace?\n2. What do chapters 20 and 21 teach us about Abraham's faith?\n3. When did you experience God's blessing after having your faith restored?\n\n\n**Genesis 21:1-21. God's promises come through the child of faith.**\n\nThe day Isaac was born brought more than the joy of bringing a new baby into the world. This day was about the fulfillment of God's promise. In chapter twelve, God called Abraham to follow him and promised he would make him into a great nation that would be a blessing to the world. God also promised to give Abraham the land of Canaan to his descendants. Finally, God promised in chapter fifteen that he would be the father of the promised seed and that Sarah (not Hagar) would be the mother. \n\nThis impossible day was fulfilled through the work of God alone and not through any help or effort of Abraham. Ishmael was the \"child of the flesh.\" Although God promised to bless this child of Abraham as well, the inheritance and ultimate redemption would come from the \"child of the Spirit.\" The fact that God told Abraham to send Ishmael and Hagar out of the camp may seem harsh and cruel. Still, there is a tremendous principle that God is teaching in the story of redemption. There would have been constant conflict if Abraham had tried to let the two sons (and wives) co-exist. But even more detrimental to the story of redemption would have been the confusion of law and grace. Ishmael was the product of Abraham's effort to fulfill the promise by his own power. By removing Ishmael from the camp, God wanted to teach Abraham and his offspring that the fulfillment of the promise would be reliant on the grace and power of God alone. \n\n1. Why is the birth of Isaac such an essential event in the story of redemption?\n2. Why did God promise to make Ishmael a mighty nation?\n3. Has there been a time in your life when being obedient to God meant making a difficult decision?\n\n**Genesis 22– When we do not withhold from God, we experience his provision.**\n\nSo often, the story of Abraham offering Isaac overshadows the story of Abraham and Ishmael, and regarding the promises of God, this would be correct. However, in the story of Abraham's journey of faith, they are both important stories to remember because one builds upon another. Every time God calls Abraham to do something, it costs him a piece of himself. He was called to leave his father and his kinsmen to travel to a new land. He was called to separate from his nephew Lot. After receiving his first son Ishmael, he was told he would not be the heir of the promise, and ultimately God commanded Abraham to send him away too. God's call and promise to Abraham came with the command to depend on God and God alone. Now God is putting Abraham's faith to the ultimate test by commanding him to sacrifice his only son by Sarah, the child of promise. Through this ultimate test of Abraham's faith, God shows Abraham that He alone has provided and will provide what is necessary to fulfill his promises. The command to sacrifice the only son that God miraculously provided through his old and barren wife seems to be the most contradicting thing that God could command. However, this story teaches us that what was ultimately sacrificed was not Isaac or the ram but Abraham's will. His obedience revealed just how much his faith had grown from the first day God called him to leave his country.  Abraham acted in faith because he believed that God would provide. It is essential to point out that the way God provided for Abraham was with a \"substitutionary sacrifice.\" This type of sacrifice is foundational to the story of redemption and is a necessary provision sinful people need to be reconciled to God. \n\n1. What does this story teach us about God?\n2. What are the elements in this story that reveal Abraham's complete faith in God?\n3. How does this story point us to Jesus?\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n**Hebrews 11:8-19 -  The ultimate act of faith is complete surrender.**\n\nThis passage gives an overview of what we have read together from Genesis chapter twelve through twenty-two.  It is Abraham's journey and progression of his faith. The first command God gave Abraham was the call to follow God to an unknown land. This step of obedience was a great act of faith, but it would prove to be just the beginning of Abraham's walk with God.  Every time God called him to do something, a more significant step of faith was needed because every command came with a call to surrender. Abraham's willingness to offer Isaac was evidence of what God had been building in Abraham from the beginning. Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his only son (of the promise) reveals his complete trust and hope in God alone. Throughout the story of Abraham, we have learned about what faith is and how essential it is in our relationship with God. We also see that faith is something God builds in us as he calls us to follow him. Our faith, like Abraham's, is put to the test to show how much we have surrendered to God. \n\n1. What is the list of examples given in this text regarding faith?\n2. In each example, what is God asking Abraham to surrender?\n3. After prayer and reflection, has God revealed to you something he calls you to surrender to build your faith?\n\n\n$$$$$$$"

One of his promises was to give them a son. They had waited twenty years, but God kept his promise, and Sarah gave birth to a baby boy. They named him Isaac, just as the Lord said.\n\nIsaac was so precious to Abraham and Sarah. He was their only son, and they had waited so long to have him. \n\nAfter many years, when Isaac had grown into a young man, the Lord came to Abraham and said, \"Take your son Isaac, whom you love, and go up the mountain and offer him there as a burnt offering.\"\n\nEven though Abraham loved Isaac more than anything else on earth, he obeyed the Lord's command because he trusted him. He believed that even if Isaac died, the Lord would bring him back to life. So, Abraham gathered the wood, and he and his son climbed to the top of the mountain.\n\n\n\"Where is the lamb to be sacrificed?\" Isaac asked his father. \n\n\"The Lord will provide one, Isaac,\" Abraham replied. \n\nWhen they reached the top, Abraham arranged the wood in a pile, then he took Isaac's wrists and bound them together. \"The Lord has commanded me to give you to him as an offering.\" Even though this meant that Isaac would die, Isaac obeyed his father and laid down on the wood. But just as Abraham took the knife, God spoke from heaven and said, \"Stop! Now I see that you trust me enough to even offer me your one and only son,\" So, Abraham quickly untied Isaac and gave him a giant hug. At that moment, Abraham caught sight of a ram stuck in the bushes by his horns. Abraham took the ram and gave it to the Lord as a burnt offering. As they stood together on the mountain top, Abraham told Isaac, \"This place will now be called, 'The Lord will provide.'\"\n\t \nAbraham's faith in the Lord was so great, he was even willing to offer him his one and only son. We should be ready to give anything to the Lord, just as Abraham did. \n\n**What is your favorite thing? Is it a particular toy, stuffed animal, or doll? Do you have a favorite bike? Maybe a best friend?\nIf the Lord asked you to give this up, would it be hard? Would you be willing to give it up for him?**",

Joseph could have been very angry with his brothers for hurting him. They threw him in a pit and then sold him as a slave. But Joseph wasn’t angry. Instead, he wanted to help them.\n\nWhen there was no more food to eat, Joseph’s brothers went to Egypt looking for grain. It was Joseph, the ruler of Egypt, who was selling the grain, but his brothers didn’t recognize him. Joseph looked and dressed like an Egyptian. \n\nJoseph saw his brothers and recognized them right away. He wanted to help them but first he would test them to see if they were still the mean and selfish brothers he remembered. So, Joseph told them to return home and come again with their youngest brother, Benjamin. \n\nWhen they returned to Joseph with Benjamin, Joseph served them a big meal, packed their donkeys with grain and sent them back home. But secretly Joseph hid a silver cup in Benjamin’s sack. His brothers had not gone far when Joseph sent his servant to chase them down and accuse them of stealing the cup. The servant found the cup in Benjamin’s sack and told them all to come back to Joseph’s house. \n\n“How could your little brother steal from me?” Joseph asked angrily, but Joseph wasn’t actually angry. He had forgiven his brothers for hurting him long ago. He was testing them to see if they would leave their little brother in Egypt like they did to him. \n\nHis brothers began to cry, “Please, don’t punish Benjamin. Punish me instead,” cried his older brother Judah. “Send Benjamin back to his father and I will take his place.”\n\nJoseph began to cry too. His brothers had changed. They wanted to protect Benjamin, not hurt him. \n\nThen Joseph surprised all of them. He took off his headdress and said, “Look! I am Joseph, your brother!”\n\nHis brothers gasped. “It’s true! It’s really you, Joseph,” they cried. Sorry for what they had done to Joseph, they hugged him. \n\n“Bring our father, Jacob, here to Egypt. I will take care of you and your families, so they don’t go hungry during the famine,” Joseph told his brothers.\n\nSo, his brothers went home to gather up their families to move to Egypt. When they told their father that Joseph was alive, he was overjoyed!\n\t\n1. **Was Joseph angry with his brothers when he saw them?** No, Joseph had forgiven his brothers. He wanted to help them.\n2. **How did Joseph know his brothers didn’t hate Benjamin like they had hated him?** When Benjamin was accused of stealing, they tried to protect their brother instead of leaving him behind to save themselves.\n\n**The Lord showed grace to Joseph. So, Joseph showed that same grace to his brothers by forgiving their sin against him. Through his death on the cross, The Lord has forgiven us a huge debt. Therefore, we can offer others that same forgiveness.**",

                        "value": "*Lesson Principle:*    \nThe story of redemption is wrought with forgiveness\n\n\n----------\n\n\n**Genesis 42 – Repentance begins with a confession of guilt**\n\nOver twenty years have passed since Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery. During his years as a slave and prisoner, his brothers enjoyed lives of respectability and high position in the land of Canaan. Now, through the act of God, the roles are reversed. Joseph finds himself staring at his brothers prostrated before him. Joseph's thoughts are immediately taken back to the very dreams that set his life in motion.\n\n\"The double identification of Joseph as administrator and provider recall Joseph's two earlier dreams, the one in which the sun, moon, and eleven stars bowed before him (his position of authority), and the other in which the brothers' sheaves bowed before his sheaf (his position of provider).\"\n\nIn wisdom, Joseph is not quick to reveal his identity to his brothers. They have not given him any reason to trust them. He continues to play the role of the Egyptian ruler, accusing them of being spies, a crime punishable by death in Egypt. With their lives now firmly in Joseph's hands, they are forced to be as honest as possible, which is what Joseph wanted. It could have very well been his plan to discern if they had killed Benjamin since they had contemplated killing Joseph as well. In the end, their three days in prison allowed Joseph to come up with a better plan to see if his brothers were honest about their youngest brother. His actions led to his brother's confession of guilt concerning their dealings with Joseph. \n\n1. What does this story reveal about Joseph's character?\n2. Why do Joseph's brothers believe they have been imprisoned?\n3. What are the similarities and differences between Joseph's imprisonment and his brother's imprisonment?\n\n**Genesis 43-44 – The fruit of confession is repentance**\n\nChapters 43 through 45 serve as a single unit, describing what happened when Joseph's brothers returned to Egypt. Upon returning to Canaan, the brothers had to persuade Jacob to let Benjamin accompany them on their next trip to Egypt, which they did with considerable difficulty. Here, we see Judah take up prominence in the story again. The position of Judah playing an acting role in this story is noteworthy. It will help the reader understand his significance throughout the narrative. Whether out of trust in Judah's word or left without another option, Jacob relents and allows Benjamin to accompany them back to Egypt. \n\nWhen they returned to Egypt, they were graciously received and treated peacefully. The scene around the banqueting table allowed Joseph to test his brothers further. The scene in Joseph's home is very insightful. Because Joseph was a member of the upper class, the Egyptian caste system required that he eat at a separate table from his Egyptian companions and servants. Because Joseph's brothers were foreigners, they would have sat at a third table, different from everyone else. What a picture! Joseph shares a meal with his brothers who, years before, had sat down to eat just after throwing Joseph in a pit. \n\nAlthough eating at the \"foreigners table,\" Benjamin was shown the highest honor by being given the most significant food portions. Joseph tested his brothers to see how they would react to their youngest brother being shown favoritism. He wanted to know if they would hate Bejamin as they had hated him. Apparently, they passed the test. \n\nThe final test that Joseph gave his brothers was the test of loyalty to Benjamin. When Benjamin is framed for stealing the cup, Judah offers himself as a substitute for Benjamin. His willingness to suffer the penalty for his brother expressed the genuineness of their loyalty to their youngest brother. It prompted them to acknowledge their guilt in the sins against Joseph. These tests proved to Joseph that his brothers were truly repentant for the sins they had committed against him all those years before.  \n\n**Genesis 45 – Forgiveness breaks down the barriers of hostility and resentment**\n\nJoseph could not keep up the act any longer. His heart overflowed with love for Benjamin and for his desire to be reconciled to his older brothers. Any anger or resentment Joseph may have held against his brothers up to this point seems to wash away. Joseph drops his guard, and the overflow of love and grace floods the room, removing the barrier between the Egyptian ruler and the helpless band of Hebrew shepherds. In this moment of revelation, Joseph explains the actual cause of his journey to Egypt and apparent rise to power. Despite his brother's sins against him, Joseph knows his life is ultimately controlled and guided by a loving God working to preserve life. This realization of God's divine love moved Joseph's heart to show compassion and forgiveness. \n\n1. What events led Joseph to reveal his true identity?\n2. According to Joseph, what was the primary reason he was brought to Egypt?\n3. What are the ripple effects of forgiveness in this chapter? How does Joseph's act of forgiveness affect everyone in this story?\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n**Matthew 18:21-35 – True forgiveness comes from the heart of God**\n\nHow was Joseph able to forgive the sins his brothers committed against him? When does forgiveness run its course? In this passage, Peter is asking Jesus about the limit of forgiveness. Jesus' answer is simple. If you are genuinely humble and compassionate, you will stop keeping count and just forgive. Jesus uses a parable to push past the act of forgiving and speak to the heart of forgiveness.\n\nJesus is not speaking about the forgiveness between God and man, but between brothers. Every Christian has received forgiveness, but some struggle to forgive others because they have not allowed that forgiveness to sink deep into their heart. When we truly understand what we have been forgiven, it overflows with gratitude, compassion, and forgiveness toward others. The servant in this parable experienced forgiveness from his master, but his heart did not share in the experience. His lack of compassion showed that this forgiveness did not lead him to repentance, a change of heart. The forgiveness Jesus speaks about is less about the act of forgiving and more about the nature of one who can forgive from the heart. \n\n1. How does this parable help inform you about the story and person of Joseph?\n2. According to Jesus' parable, what is necessary for us to forgive others?\n3. Have you been forgiven of your sin but cannot forgive someone who has hurt you? How can you experience forgiveness from the heart?\n\n$$$$$$$\n"

What are we to do?”\t\n\nJacob groaned. He wondered why did everything have to be so hard. His life had consisted of one hardship after another, yet through it all the Lord was with him. Now, a famine had come upon them and the food they had stored had almost run out. Anxiety gripped him as he weighed his options. The stories of both his father, Isaac and his grandfather, Abraham, came to mind. They had taken their whole family and moved to Egypt to survive. He hoped this would not be necessary. The family had grown a great deal since his father’s generation. Even Judah had added to their numbers when he returned with his three sons. Jacob had no desire to leave this land the Lord had promised him. As much as it pained him, his only option was to send his sons. \n\nJacob called them to his tent and said, “I have heard that Egypt is selling grain to all the nations. You must go and bring back food from Egypt. It’s the only way we can survive.”\n\nHis sons agreed and said, “We will take every donkey in order to bring back as much as possible.”\n\n“The ten of you will go, but Benjamin, you will stay here with me,” Jacob instructed. Almost twenty years had passed since he had lost Joseph, and the sadness over his favorite son had never diminished. He certainly wouldn’t risk sending Benjamin alone with his brothers, like he did with Joseph. \n\nBy the next day, Jacob’s sons had packed what they needed and prepared the donkeys. The animals were weak from so little food, but they hoped to feed them well on their arrival in Egypt before undertaking the hard journey back to Hebron. \n\nMeanwhile, as they made their way south, Joseph continued his work governing over the land. From north, south, east, and west came people searching for food. Word had spread far and wide that Egypt had grain and Joseph was there to meet each one of them. One by one they filled their sacks and carried them away. \n\nThen one morning, as Joseph arrived to oversee the distribution of grain, he spotted ten men and their donkeys patiently waiting their turn. “No, it couldn’t be,” he said to himself. But as he took a closer look, his heart began to beat heavily in his chest. “It was them!” he whispered as joy and excitement welled up, but nonetheless impaired by painful memories. \n\nWhen it was their turn, Joseph’s brothers bent down and bowed to him, their faces touching the ground. Speechless, Joseph remembered the bundles of wheat bowing to his bundle of wheat. More than twenty years later, his dream had come to pass.\n\n“Where do you come from?” Joseph asked harshly, speaking to them in the Egyptian tongue. \n\n“We are from the land of Canaan,” Reuben said. Not one of them had suspected that this Egyptian governor might be Joseph. His shaven head and costly Egyptian attire had made him unrecognizable. Joseph motioned to his Hebrew interpreter. When the man stepped forward, Reuben continued, “We have come to buy food.” \n\nThe interpreter waited and then translated Reuben’s words into Egyptian for Joseph. Giving no indication that he understood their language, Joseph waited for the translation and said, “It is a little suspicious to see a few men arrive with so many donkeys. You must come from a wealthy nation. It seems to me that you are spies. Have you come to see the nakedness of the land?” Joseph challenged.  \n\n“No, my lord. We are not spies,” explained Reuben nervously. “We have simply come to buy food on behalf of our father. He is wealthy, but we are a small nation. We are all his sons. Truly, we are honest men.”\n\n“No, you only wanted to come and see how the famine has devastated Egypt,” Joseph continued.\n\n“Please, my lord, we have never been spies. We are just a family who wants to survive the famine. We are all brothers, twelve altogether. Our father lives in the land of Canaan and our youngest brother is with him. We had one more brother, but now he is gone,” Reuben said with a hint of sadness.\n\nJoseph cleared his throat and said one last time, “Well, I have to assume you are spies until your words are tested to see if they are truthful. I will let one of you return to your homeland and bring back your brother while the rest of you remain here. You will not be allowed to leave unless your youngest brother comes. For now, you will be put into custody.” Then Joseph sent his brothers off with the guards to Pharaoh’s prison, the very place he had come out of.\n\nFor two days, they remained confined while Joseph considered how to handle his brothers. Curious to see if the jealousy in their hearts had changed, he was determined to see if they hated his younger brother Benjamin as much as they had hated him. Then, on the third day, Joseph called for them. “I realize that I am in a place of divine authority and since I fear God, I will be generous. Only one of you will remain here while the rest of you may go back to Canaan with grain for your households. If you are truly as honest as you say you are, then you will return with your youngest brother. Then, I will know you are speaking truth, and I won’t have to put you to death for espionage.”\n\nShaken by the potential consequences for failing to return with their brother, Judah turned to his brothers and said, “You know we had this coming. For twenty years our hands have been stained with the blood of our brother. We may not be guilty of espionage, but we certainly deserve death for what we did to Joseph. The anguish of his soul cried out for help from the bottom of that pit, and we did nothing!” \n\nHis brothers nodded and hung their heads, ashamed of the atrocity they had committed. \n\nFrustrated at the situation before them, Reuben said, “I told you not to sin against Joseph! But, of course, you didn’t listen to me. Now look at what’s happened. We are paying the price for spilling his blood.”\n\nUnbeknownst to Joseph’s brothers, he heard and understood every word they confessed. Unable to contain his emotion, he stood and quickly left them. Were they truly sorry for what they had done? Joseph wondered as he collapsed on the floor and wept. Moments passed, while years of pain forced their way to the surface. Because of his love for them, he had long ago forgiven their sins against him, but it felt like the wound that had taken so long to heal had just reopened. \n\nFinally, Joseph wiped the tears from his eyes, smearing the kohl that so distinctively disguised him as an Egyptian. Revenge would be easy to take, given his authority over them, yet his desire was mercy. Yahweh had shown him far more grace than he ever deserved, so he simply wished to offer it to them as well. Therefore, he made the decision to keep one of them in custody instead of all nine. Since Reuben had kept his brothers from murder, the second oldest would take on the responsibility. \n\nReturning to his brothers, Joseph took some rope and bound Simeon’s hands. “This one will go back to prison and remain until you bring back your brother,” he explained.\n\n“But what will we tell our father when we return without our brother?” Reuben asked, despairingly. However, Joseph only turned to the servants and in Egyptian ordered, “Fill their sacks with grain and pack provisions for their journey as well. Then, place the money each of them paid at the top of each sack. Make sure they don’t see you put it there.”\n\nLater that morning, the nine remaining brothers loaded their donkeys with the grain and departed for Canaan. Their trek across the desert was dry and dismal, not unlike their mood. Fear of their reunion with Jacob loaded them down as much as the grain on their donkeys. When the sun disappeared below the horizon, they made a small camp and took care of the animals. Levi was the first to open his sack of grain to feed his donkey. What he found caused their fear to rise even further.\n\n“My money is in here!” Levi called out. “Someone put it back into my sack!”\n\n“What!?” Reuben cried, a lump forming in his throat.\n\n“Why is God punishing us?” Judah asked in anguish. “Are we to add thief to our accusation of spy as well?”\n\nAll nine of them, trembling and troubled, slept very little that night in addition to almost every night after until they arrived in Hebron. It was even worse when they found, not just Levi’s money, but all their money returned in every single sack. When they explained to their father that they needed to take Benjamin back to Egypt, Jacob responded just as they had feared. \n\n“You have robbed me of my children! How could you do this to me?” he howled. “Joseph is gone. Simeon is gone. Now you want to take Benjamin too? How could I lose so much? Everything is against me!” \n\nDesperate to please his father, Reuben made a rash offer. “Father, you may kill my two sons if I do not bring Benjamin back to you. Trust me. I will return with him.”\n\n“Benjamin will not go with you! I cannot allow it,” Jacob replied firmly. “His brother, Joseph, is dead and he is the only son left from my dear wife, Rachel,” he continued. “It is more than I could bear if something happened to him on the journey. He simply cannot go.”\n\t\t\n**Why did Joseph’s brothers go to Egypt?** They went to Egypt to buy food because of the famine.\n\n**Was Joseph angry with his brothers when he saw them?** No, he wanted to help them, but first he wanted to test them to see if their hearts had changed.\n\n**Given Joseph’s authority, in what other ways could he have treated his brothers?** 1. Joseph could have taken revenge on his brothers by enslaving them or keeping them in prison. 2. He could have chosen to remain cut off from his family and sent them away. Instead of wishing them harm, he wanted to help them because he had already forgiven their sin against him.\n\n**In Matthew 18, the king forgave the great debt his servant owed. Do you owe a great debt to your king? If so, how will you repay it?** We owe a great debt to the King of the Universe, because of our sin. The good news is that Jesus has offered to pay it for us, but we must humbly ask for forgiveness.\n\n** Day 2 - Genesis 43**\n\nIt wasn’t long before the sacks of grain they had carried from Egypt were empty. The famine had become so severe that the ground was almost bare and the wells were beginning to run dry. Left with no other option, Jacob instructed his sons to go back to Egypt and buy more food. \n\n“But Father, we can’t go without Benjamin,” Judah reminded him. “The governor of Egypt warned us not to enter Egypt again without him.”\n\nJacob sighed, “Why you told the governor that you had another brother, I have no idea. You certainly didn’t consider me when you decided to use him as the guarantee of your word. How could you forget how precious Benjamin is to me?”\n\n“I am sorry, Father. The governor asked us so many questions about ourselves and our family. He asked if you were still alive. He also asked if we had another brother. What was I supposed to say? We had no idea that he would ask to see him!” Judah tried to explain, but his father only groaned with disappointment. \n\n“Send Benjamin with me so we can get the food we need. Otherwise, we may all die of starvation here. I offer myself as a pledge for his safety. If anything happens to him, I will take all the responsibility and you may blame me forever,” Judah offered earnestly.\n\n“What other choice do I have?” Jacob said, yielding. \n\n“I am afraid we have waited too long. We must leave right away. We could have gone to Egypt twice already,” Judah urged. \n\n“You must not leave without gifts for the governor,” Jacob instructed, leading his sons to another tent. “Take this balm and honey. Take some fruit. Take myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds to give to him.”\n\nJudah nodded and called the servant to begin packing. “What about the money, Father?” he asked.\n\n“Take double the money with you. Perhaps the money that was put back in your sacks was an oversight,” Jacob said, hoping to appease the governor with gifts. “Now, go and take Benjamin with you. I only hope that God Almighty will grant you mercy when you stand before this great man in Egypt. May he send all eleven of you back safely.” Looking helpless and defeated, Jacob said finally, “As for me, if my children are taken from me, then I must accept it.”\n\nJudah loaded the donkeys and set out that very afternoon, promising once more to guard Benjamin with his life. Before they knew it, they were once again in front of Joseph.\n\nJoseph was at the grain distribution site that morning when he saw his brothers arrive. So much time had passed that Joseph had almost given up hope that they would return. However, at the sight of his little brother, something in Joseph, that had been cold for so long, began to warm. \n\n“Bring the men to my house,” Joseph said to his steward. “Prepare some meat and plan a meal. We will eat at noon.”\n\nThe steward bowed and led Joseph’s brothers and their donkeys toward the house. “Why is he taking us to his own home?” Asher asked, looking nervous. \n\n“It’s probably because of our money, which was put back in our sacks. Since it looks like we didn’t pay for the grain the first time, he will accuse us of being thieves,” Levi said. “Then he will have us assaulted, take our donkeys, and force us to be his servants!”\n\nJudah decided to be proactive. When they reached the door of the house, he stopped the steward and explained, “My lord, after we bought food last time, we opened our sacks on the way home and found all of the money we paid put back. We don’t know who put it there, but we brought the money back plus more money to buy additional grain.”\n\nTo Judah’s surprise, the steward did not look angry or surprised. He simply said, “Peace, there is no need to fear. Your God and the God of your father put that treasure in your sacks for you. As for your money, I received it.”\n\nThen the steward told them to wait, while he disappeared behind the house. When he came back, he had Simeon with him. Delighted, Levi embraced his brother along with the others. \n\n“Now, come in the house and wash your feet and have some water while I feed your donkeys,” the steward commanded.\n\nWhile he was with the donkeys, the brothers prepared the gifts they had brought for Joseph. When he arrived, they brought in the fruit and the nuts, the balm and the honey, and bowed down to the ground before him. Once again, Joseph remembered his dream from so long ago. They were all back together again, the only one missing was his father.\n\n“How are your families?” he asked, “and your father, the old man you told me about. How is he? Is he still alive?”\n\nHis brothers looked confused. They wondered why this powerful Egyptian was so interested in the welfare of a group of Hebrew shepherds. Nevertheless, they responded obediently. \n\n“Our father is alive. He is well,” Judah stated. Then they bowed again, bringing their face to the floor before him.\n\nRecognizing Benjamin, his only brother who shared his mother, Rachel, he said, “This must be your youngest brother. May God be gracious to you, son!” Joseph exclaimed, but his words were quickly choked up as a wave of compassion warmed his heart. Rushing from the room, Joseph left his brothers prostrated on the floor as he ran to his room and wept uncontrollably. For so long he had built walls around his heart, protecting himself from his family. Yet now, at the sight of Benjamin, the walls were crumbling. Love and compassion, feelings he never thought he would have for his Hebrew family again, had returned. \n\nGetting control of himself, Joseph washed his face and returned. “Serve the food,” he ordered the servants. Joseph sat alone at his own table, according to Egyptian custom. The Egyptians also kept strict laws about eating with Hebrews. Therefore, the servants served his brothers, from oldest to youngest, at a separate table and set a third table for themselves.\n\nJudah watched in amazement as they were each handed a plate of delicious food usually intended for guests of honor. He looked down at the other end of the table and saw Benjamin’s plate. It was twice as full as theirs and the servants kept serving him more until he had five times as much. Normally, this kind of special treatment would have sparked jealously amongst the other brothers, but they all seemed to be delighted for Benjamin. Perhaps, they were simply overjoyed by the mercy that had been granted to them. He certainly was.\n\t\n**Who promised to protect Benjamin when they took him to Egypt?** Judah gave his life as a pledge for Benjamin’s. This is evidence of Judah’s change of heart. He took responsibility for the welfare of his brother and his father.\n\n**Why did Joseph give Benjamin so much extra food at the meal?** It was probably out of love for his brother, as well as a test to the others to see if they would be jealous of Benjamin’s special treatment.\n\n**In Matthew 18, after the king forgives the servant his debt, the servant goes and demands that his fellow servant pay him what he owes. Is this how Joseph responded to his brothers?** When someone hurts you, do you respond like the unforgiving servant or like Joseph responded towards his brothers? Unlike the servant, Joseph did not demand anything from his brothers even though they owed him a great debt. He forgave them what they owed and blessed them with much more. \n\t\n**Day 3 - Genesis 44**\n\nJoseph had plans for one more test. Did the extra portions of food he showered upon Benjamin trigger the jealousy amongst his brothers like he had experienced so long ago? He would find out if they wished the same fate upon Benjamin as they had with him. \n\n“Fill the men’s sacks with grain and replace the money they paid, like you did last time. Then, place my special silver cup in the mouth of the youngest man’s sack, as well,” Joseph instructed his steward.\n\nThe next morning, Judah and the others loaded their donkeys and set off towards Hebron. However, they had scarcely left the city when they heard shouts and hoofbeats from behind them.\n\n“Stop! In the name of Pharaoh, stop, thieves!” the guards shouted. \n\nCaught off guard, the brothers halted their donkeys, wondering what could have possibly happened this time. They recognized the governor’s steward as he stepped out of his chariot. \n\n“How could you repay my master with evil, after all the good he has done for you? How could you take the silver cup that my master drinks from?” the steward accused.\n\n“My lord,” Judah answered, “How could we do something like this? We were honest and brought back the extra money from the last time we were here. Why then would we go and steal silver or gold after that? I know for certain we are innocent. If you find it here in our possession, you may bring the penalty of death upon the man who stole it and the rest of us will be your servants,” Judah offered.\n\n“I will hold you to your word then. The one who has the cup will be my servant,” the steward agreed.\n\nThus, each of the brothers lifted their sacks from their donkeys and opened them for the steward as he searched them, starting with Reuben and ending with Benjamin, the youngest. “So, seems that one of you has indeed stolen the cup. It is here in the sack of your youngest brother,” he exclaimed.\n\n“What!? How could this be?” Judah cried, falling to his knees. His brothers looked at Benjamin in dismay, tearing their clothing in fear and dread of what this meant for him. \n\nStartled at their display of emotion, the steward said, “Load up your donkeys and follow me.”\n\nWhen they arrived at Joseph’s house, his brothers fell before him and he said, “What have you done? I hope you know that I have supernatural insight to uncover anything hidden.”\n\n“I don’t know what to say, my lord. How can we make this right? God has revealed our guilt,” Judah exclaimed. Judah understood that they may not be specifically at fault for stealing the cup, but God had used this to expose their guiltiness in the treatment of Joseph. With a contrite heart, Judah declared, “We are condemned, my lord. All of us. Make us your servants. We all deserve it.”\n\n“I will not make all of you my servants. Only your brother who had the cup in his sack,” Joseph replied, testing them to see if they would abandon Benjamin. “As for the rest of you, you may go in peace and return to your father.” \n\nTrembling, Judah approached Joseph, “I understand you are like Pharaoh himself, my lord. Is it too much to ask to speak with you privately, my lord?”\n\nJoseph nodded and Judah continued to mediate on behalf of his brother. “Remember when we told you about our father and how he would die if our youngest brother were separated from him? Well, when we returned and told him that we could not return to Egypt unless Benjamin was with us, he said to me, ‘You know that my wife, Rachel, gave me two sons. The oldest is gone, probably torn to pieces and I haven’t seen him since. If you take Benjamin with you and something happens to him, you will cause my gray hairs to go to the grave!’”\n\n“So, I cannot go back without my brother, or it will kill him,” Judah pleaded. “When we brought him here, I offered myself as a pledge to ensure his safety. If I don’t return with him, I agreed to bare the blame before my father all my life. I am begging you, please let me take my brother’s place. I will remain here as your servant so he can go back to my father.”\n\nJoseph could not respond. He began to tremble even more than Judah. He hung his head, fighting back tears. Judah and his brothers simply waited. Perplexed at the reaction of this powerful Egyptian leader, second only to Pharaoh.  \n\t\n**In whose sack did Joseph place the silver cup?** He had it placed in Benjamin’s sack.\n\n**Who stepped in on Benjamin’s behalf? What did he offer?** Judah stepped in for Benjamin and asked to take his place as a servant. \n\n**What did the tests reveal about Joseph’s brothers?** After being tested, Joseph saw that they were truly sorry for how they had sinned. They no longer cared only for themselves, but cared more for their brother and their father.\n\n** Day 4 - Genesis 45**\n\nJudah’s words forced the wound in Joseph’s heart wide open. These were the words he had longed to hear. Words that came from a heart willing to lay his life down for the sake of his brother. No longer were his brothers seeking their own interests, but were looking out for the interests of their father and their brother. He could no longer hold in the tears. Weeping uncontrollably, Joseph said to the Egyptian servants, “Leave. All of you, except these eleven men.”\n\nUnable to speak, Joseph’s weeping became wails of emotion. Heard even by the household of Pharaoh, Joseph’s cries were not of sadness, but joy and love for his brothers. “I am Joseph! Your brother Joseph,” he said between sobs.\n\nMore than shocked at the news, his brothers said nothing. “What?!” Judah said, unable to comprehend the words he had just heard.\n\n“Is my father still alive?” Joseph asked, but they could not answer as they remained knelt before him in dismay. “Come here. Come close to me.”\n\nHis brothers got to their feet and gathered around him. They looked beyond his clean-shaven face and elaborate headdress. They peered into his eyes and saw the eyes of their father.\n\n“It’s me. Your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into slavery.”\n\n“How could this be?” thought Judah. After what he had done to Joseph, he believed him to be suffering as a slave these last twenty years. He never thought he would see him again. Yet here he was, the ruler over the land of Egypt.  \n\n“Don’t feel bad about selling me. It was the God of our fathers who sent me here ahead of you to save our lives. For two years now, the famine has devastated the earth, and yet we have five more to endure where there will be no harvest. God sent me here to rule in Egypt, so our nation would survive this great ordeal. It was his purpose for me, so don’t be angry with yourselves.”  \n\nJoseph’s brothers began to weep, unable to comprehend the grace their brother was offering them.\n\nJoseph continued saying, “You must hurry back to Father and tell him where God has led me. Tell him to come to Egypt. I will give you the land of Goshen outside the city. It will be enough for all your families and livestock. You will be near me, and I can provide for all your needs over these next five years. “ \n\nJoseph reached out his arms and Benjamin met his embrace as they wept upon one another’s shoulders. In a grand display of reconciliation, one by one, the others embraced the brother they had once betrayed. \n\nWhen Pharaoh heard that Joseph’s brothers had come, he instructed Joseph to have his brothers load up their donkeys and travel back to Canaan to collect their father and all their households. Then they would receive the best of the land of Egypt, just as Joseph had said.  \n\nSo, after a long afternoon of conversation, Joseph brought his brothers out to pack their donkeys. He gave them wagons from Egypt to carry the women and children and provisions for the journey. Then he loaded twenty donkeys with gifts, grain, and bread from Egypt for his father. Finally, he gave his brothers clothing and to Benjamin 300 shekels of silver. \n\nWhen everything was prepared, Joseph embraced the sons of Israel and sent them out. He called after them, “Don’t quarrel on the way! There will be much waiting for you here when you return.”\n\nJacob looked across the field that was once a luscious green and saw the cloud of dust marking his sons’ return. “Was Benjamin with them?” he wondered. He was afraid to find out the truth. They were certainly returning with much more than they had left with. Then Benjamin appeared, leaving his donkey behind and running to his father. Jacob’s fears were put to rest and relief came over him with his son once again at his side. \n\n“I have tremendous news, Father,” Benjamin said as his brothers came to greet their father as well. “Joseph is still alive! He is ruler over all of Egypt,” he explained.\n\nJacob went numb. “How could you torture me with an outrageous story like that?”\n\n“It’s true, Father,” Judah explained. “Joseph is the governor of Egypt who demanded to see Benjamin. He said that God put him there to save our family from the famine. He has offered us some of the best land in Egypt. He wants you to come there.”\n\nJacob only shook his head in unbelief. “Look, Father,” Reuben said, pointing to the wagons. “He sent this wagon to carry you there. These donkeys are gifts for you as well.”\n\nThen Jacob’s eyes brightened. He said, “I see now. You are telling me the truth. My son, Joseph, is truly alive! How greatly I am blessed! Yes, we will go to Egypt. I must see him before I die.”  \n\t\n**When Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, did he demand something from them for hurting him?** No, Joseph didn’t ask them to apologize. He even told them not to feel bad about what they did to him.\n\n**From Joseph’s perspective, who was responsible for sending him to Egypt?** Joseph told his brothers that it was God who sent him there so he could save them from the famine. He didn’t blame his brothers.\n\n**In Matthew 18, unlike Joseph, the servant could not forgive his fellow servant for what he owed him. What were the consequences of that?** The king found out that the servant could not extend the same grace to others that he had been given. So, the king put the servant in prison until he could pay his debt back. \n\n**Have you forgiven those who have sinned against you? Or have you remained angry with them, demanding they repay you in some way?** Forgiveness is a difficult thing, but when we truly see the great debt of sin we have been forgiven by our Savior, then it is natural to offer grace towards others around us and forgive the sins against us.  \n\n**The Lord showed grace to Joseph. So, Joseph showed that same grace to his brothers by forgiving their sin against him. Through the death of his son on the cross, the Lord has forgiven us the huge debt we owe for our sin. Therefore, we can offer others that same forgiveness.**\n\n"

Do you remember the rule the Lord gave to Adam? He told Adam he could eat from every tree in the garden except the one in the midst of the garden called the tree of knowledge. Do you think he chose to do as the Lord said? Let’s find out…\n\n Now Adam and his wife, called Eve, were tremendously happy in the garden with the Lord Yahweh. They worked together, doing as Yahweh said by caring for the plants and animals. One day, Adam and Eve met a very tricky serpent who said to her, “Did God actually sssay you are not allowed to eat any of thisss deliciousss fruit in the garden?”\n\n“Oh no!” Eve said. “We may eat from the trees in the garden, but God said we are not to eat the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden and we are not to touch it, or we will die.” \n\nBut as they came near the tree, the serpent said,” Sssurely you will not die. Go ahead, eat it, it will make you like God.” Hmmm, it does look delicious, she thought to herself, and she picked the fruit from the tree. Then she took a bite and passed it to Adam. He ate the fruit as well, doing what Yahweh told them not to do.\nAfter they ate the fruit, they felt embarrassed and realized they had no clothes on. So, they made some clothes from the leaves. Then a wind began to blow. Yahweh was looking for them. “Where are you Adam?” Yahweh called out. “Have you eaten from the tree I told you not to eat? You will have to leave the garden now because you did not listen to me.” Then he made Adam and Eve clothing made of animal skin and sent them into the unknown. But Yahweh had already made a plan to bring them back to him one day.\n\nThe first man, Adam, disobeyed which brought death but a second man, Yeshua, obeyed the Lord, and brought life.",

                        "value": "**A narrative for the young based on the lesson’s text**\n\n“Adam? Where are you?” Crouching over a small grapevine, Adam straightened and caught sight of his beloved wife walking through the dense fruit trees of the garden. “I am over here, Eve,” he called out. Adam had been focused on cultivating the soil and preparing some new grapevines for planting. Eve usually loved helping Adam tend the garden. She also loved exploring the garden in the hopes she would discover something new. Nothing was as wonderful as the walks Adam and Eve would take through the garden with Yahweh in the cool of the evening. It was the perfect place, the perfect couple, in a perfect relationship with their creator.\n\n As Eve approached, Adam was reminded once again how much he loved her. He would do anything for her. He patted the soil around the vine and took Eve to their favorite place in the garden. Here they would lay in the grass, side by side, watching the birds by day and the stars by night. They would talk for hours about the goodness of Yahweh and the beauty of his creation. But this afternoon seemed different. They sat in silence, admiring the trees surrounding them, bursting with fruit. Then Adam asked, “What did you find as you explored the garden this morning?” “I was searching for roses when I met the serpent again,” Eve said. Adam looked confused. “Remember, I helped untangle him from a thornbush. It took most of the afternoon, but the poor thing was really stuck.” Eve reminded him. “I saw him again today. Despite his many questions, it was very pleasant speaking with him. He is very kind and respectful, always praising me for my knowledge about Yahweh and expressing what a beautiful creation I am. He certainly has a curiosity about Yahweh and his plan for the garden. He asked about the tree in the midst of the garden…” Adam sat up with a jerk. “We are NOT to eat from that tree! Don’t even touch it!” he said, raising his voice. “Okay, Okay, Adam. I was just wondering.” The couple sat in silence and eventually Adam drifted off to sleep, as he did most afternoons. \n\nFrustrated that Adam had raised his voice to her, Eve stood and left Adam to his rest and to look for the serpent, eager to continue their conversation. She hadn’t gone far when the serpent appeared behind her, “Eve,” he called out. Startled, Eve turned to see the serpent emerge from behind the tree. “Oh, hello,” she replied. The serpent came close fervently seeking her attention. “I am so glad I found you,” he said. “You are the only one who helps me truly understand more about Yahweh. He is so powerful and creative. Look at this beautiful orchard and look at you. You are a perfect trophy for his garden. You and Adam work so hard here to take care of his creation. Tell me though, did God actually say you are not allowed to eat any of this fruit in the garden? Why would he withhold that from you? You deserve better than that.” “Oh no!” she said. “We may eat from the trees in the garden, but God said we are not to eat the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden and we are not to touch it, or we will die.” \n\nThe serpent began to head towards the midst of the garden. “Please, Eve, show me which tree it is. I don’t want to accidentally eat from it,” the serpent pleaded. “Alright, but we can’t get too close,” she reluctantly agreed. The bright afternoon seemed to darken a bit as Eve and the serpent made their way deeper into the garden. Finally, they came to a clearing in the vegetation and before them stood the most magnificent tree Eve had ever seen. When she saw the ripe fruit hanging from its branches, she began to feel very hungry. “Incredible!” the serpent exclaimed. “Did God really say you are not to eat of it? Surely, if God is as good as you say, he would not keep you from this tree. The fruit looks delicious! Certainly, you will not die if you eat it.” \nThe grass rustled behind them with the sound of approaching footsteps and suddenly Adam appeared. “Adam, what are you doing here?” “I heard you speaking with the serpent and followed you,” he said nervously. “I don’t think you should be here, we should probably go back,” reaching for her hand. But the serpent interrupted, grabbing Eve’s attention, “If this is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, indeed God knows that when you eat its fruit your eyes will be opened, and you will know evil as well as good. You will then, be like God.” Eve looked at Adam. Intrigued by the words of the serpent, he stepped closer to the tree, admiring the fruit. “Don’t you want to be as wise as God?” the serpent pressed. Eve considered what the serpent said. It was true, she thought, why would God keep her from wisdom? The serpent had climbed into the tree, his weight causing the branch to bow down towards Eve. With delicate fingers, Eve reached out and picked off the fruit. Turning it in her hand, she once again considered the words of the serpent… “You will be wise.” She looked to Adam one last time, but he remained silent. Then she slowly bit into the fruit. It was as delicious as she had imagined. Adam came closer as she handed the fruit to him. He hesitated a moment and then took the fruit and ate. \n\nThey had barely swallowed the first bite when everything began to change. Eve looked at Adam, but he turned away, unable to look her in the eye. A breeze picked up, rustling the leaves. Feeling chilled, Eve folded her arms. She looked down at herself. She felt so exposed! She looked over her shoulder for the serpent but thankfully, he had disappeared. Quickly, she crouched behind a bush, desperately looking for somewhere to hide. “Here, use these,” Adam barked at her, as he threw some large fig leaves at her. Eve carefully tried to cover her body with the vegetation, but they were a poor excuse for clothing. She considered digging a hole and hiding in it, but she wasn’t sure if even that would be enough to cover her shame. Equally guilty, Adam had covered himself as well. The breeze became a wind as the two darted into a thick covering of trees as if they could escape it. Fear grew, as they desperately tried to hide themselves from Yahweh. The beat of their anxious hearts seemed to match his footsteps as he searched the garden for them. \n\n“Adam?” Yahweh called. “Where are you?” Realizing he could no longer hide, Adam presented himself. “I realized I was naked, so I was afraid for you to see me,” he said. “Who told you that you were naked?” Yahweh asked him. Sheepishly, Adam pointed to the tree where Eve was hiding. “The woman you gave me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate.” Eve slowly stood and emerged from her hiding place, “What have you done, Eve?” Yahweh asked. “The serpent tricked me into believing it was good for me to eat,” Eve explained. \n\n“Serpent!” Yahweh summoned. The serpent gracefully climbed down from the tree overhead, clearly having been eavesdropping. “You are now cursed because of what you have done. You will crawl on your belly among the lowest of the animals. One day a man will come to earth and you will wound him, but he will destroy you.”\n\nThen Yahweh turned to the woman and said, “From now on, peace in your marriage will be difficult. You will desire to control your husband and he will dominate you. Also, when you bear children, it will be very painful.”\nFinally, he turned to Adam and said, “I commanded you not to eat of this tree, but you did not listen and do as I commanded. So, because you listened and obeyed the voice of your wife instead, the ground is now cursed because of you. You ate what was forbidden, so now you must work hard to eat. There will be pain and sweat as you cultivate the earth and because you were made from earth, you will return to the earth when you die.” Yahweh addressed both Adam and Eve and said, “These are the harsh conditions in which you now must live because you chose to resist my authority.”\n\nThen he looked sadly at them and turned to leave.  Full of guilt and remorse, Adam pulled Eve into his arms as she sobbed uncontrollably.  The sun had long since fallen behind the trees when Yahweh returned with clothing made of skins. Shaken by the sight of them, Adam asked, “Did these come from some of your beloved animals?”. “Yes, Adam, leaves are not enough to cover the shame of your sin. Blood must be spilt in order to cover your guilt.” And Yahweh gently draped the two of them in the skins he provided. “Now you must leave this garden.” So, Yahweh placed his guards, the Cherubim, at the gate with a flaming sword. As they walked into the unknown, Adam held Eve and said, “There is hope, beloved. Yahweh has provided. We still have the opportunity to obey his command to multiply. You are, after all, Eve, the mother of all living.”\n \n**We are born sinners because of one man’s disobedience but God has offered us forgiveness and life through the obedience of his son Yeshua. **"

It was perfect. Everything was as God intended it to be. Now chapter 3 begins with a shift in the story by introducing a new character. Based upon other texts in scripture it seems Satan possessed and controlled the serpent to present himself as harmless and friendly. Satan’s plan of deception was to engage in a debate, plant the seed of doubt, to lead Eve to deny God’s Word.\n\n1. How does the serpent sow the seed of doubt?\n2. In what way was the serpent right in what he said and in what way was he wrong?\n3. What is Adam’s sin?\n\n\n**Genesis 3:7-13 –Adam and Eve try to cover and hide.**\n\nOne of the most pivotal moments in history is described in three words, “and he ate”. The Bible does not say that the moment Adam bit into the fruit there was a tremendous change in their environment. The text simply says they “knew” they were naked. This word “knew” in the original text means “to notice”. From the moment they realized they were naked, the consequences for their disobedience began to unfold. This chapter is the epicentre of the creation story and this moment sets the course of human history, a history of pain and suffering. But God is merciful, and he has been working to restore mankind from the moment Adam and Eve disobeyed. \n\n1. What is the first consequence Adam and Eve experienced when their “eyes were opened”?\n2. How did Adam and Eve respond to God’s questioning?\n3. What motivated Adam and Eve’s response to God?\n\n**Genesis 3:14-24 –God’s judgment and his act of mercy.**\n\nAfter questioning the man and the woman, God lays out the new conditions for life under the curse of sin. However, the story ends with God graciously providing for Adam and Eve and leaving the reader with a promise that man will one day defeat his enemy. God was unfolding a plan to restore man to a right relationship with Him. Satan is now declared the enemy of man, and although he initiated the first blow, God would work through a descendant of Eve to destroy the enemy forever. \n\n1. What was the consequence of the woman’s deception?\n2. What were the consequences of Adam’s sin?  \n3. What does this text reveal to us about God?\n\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n\n**Romans 5:12-21 – the condemnation of the first Adam and the justification of the 2nd Adam**\n\nAdam’s one act of disobedience did not only affect him and his family, but the entire human race. From that moment on, every descendent of Adam inherited sin and death, both physically and spiritually, separating us from fellowship with God. Some might find it hard to accept that we must suffer the punishment of death because of Adam’s sin. It is important to remember that although sin is passed down from Adam, we are not guilty of his sin, but we are guilty of our own sin. This means we are condemned: God has declared us guilty as we await our punishment of death. BUT, a second man came to restore what Adam had done. Paul uses the word “justification”, which means we have been put back in a right standing with God (righteous), back to the relationship Adam had in the garden with the Lord before his act of disobedience.\n\n\n1. Why is Adam the one responsible for sin when it was Eve who sinned first?\n2. What is the evidence of humankind’s sin?\n3. What is the contrast between the first Adam, and Jesus, the second Adam? \n\n\n**Action!** Spend time in prayer and praise. Spend time in confession and then praise him for his abounding grace by which we come to receive the righteousness of Jesus. \n\n$$$$$$$\n\n",

It began when Sarai was unable to have the child God had promised to Abram. Sarai thought she could help the Lord fulfill his promise by asking her servant Hagar to have the baby for her. But when Hagar became pregnant, she laughed and made fun of Sarai because she could have a baby and Sarai couldn’t.  So, Sarai treated Hagar harshly and sent her away. \n\nHagar traveled into the wilderness all alone. She was very sad, but the Lord saw her sadness. He came to her and said, “I will bless you, Hagar. You will have a son and his name will be Ishmael. Now, go back to Sarai and serve her.”\n\nHagar returned to Abram and Sarai where she gave birth to a baby boy, and she called him Ishmael, just as the Lord had said. When Ishmael was older, the Lord gave a sign to Abram and Ishmael and every man in Abram’s household. This sign was the assurance that God would fulfill his promise of land, children, and blessing for Abram’s entire family.\n\n“Abram,” the Lord said. “This time next year, you will have a son, and his name will be called Isaac.”\n\nAbram laughed and so did his wife Sarai. “We are too old to have children!” they said.\n\n“Is anything too hard for God to accomplish?” the Lord asked. “You shall now be called Abraham and Sarah.”\n\n**Abraham was a friend of the Lord because he trusted him.

This helped to guarantee an heir to carry on their name and heritage.  It seems Sarai gets tired of waiting on God’s promise and decides to help him along by engaging in this common practice. Abram finds his wife's argument logical and so takes Hagar, Sarai’s servant girl, as his wife, producing a child.  The consequences for their compromise will be greater than either of them will ever realize. After Hagar finds out she is pregnant she thinks herself to be a bit more superior to Sarai causing tension between the two women.  So, Hagar runs away, presumably attempting to go back to Egypt, which results in the first appearance of the “Angel of the Lord” who tells Hagar to go back and remain a servant to her mistress, promising to bless her child as well. The Apostle Paul tells us in Galatians 4 that the children of Hagar illustrate the children of the flesh who remain enslaved to the law, contrasted with Sarai’s descendants who illustrate the children of the promised blessing, received through faith. \n\n1. What were the circumstances that led Sarai to conclude that the best course of action was to offer Hagar to Abram?\n2. What does God's dealings with Hagar show us about his character?\n3. What are some circumstances in your life that led you to compromise your faith in God?\n\n\n**Genesis 17:1-14 – The covenant of circumcision depended on Abram’s obedience.**\n\nThirteen years after the birth of Ishmael God spoke to Abram again. God called himself a new name: El Shaddai (the Almighty God). This was appropriate in view of what God was about to reveal to Abram concerning Sarai. God breaks his silence by commanding Abram to circumcise himself and every male in his household as a sign to confirm God’s covenant. This sign was a physical demonstration of the obedient faith of Abram and his descendants. It is important to hold the Abrahamic Covenant and the covenant of circumcision together, and yet distinct. Whereas the Abrahamic Covenant was unconditional, the covenant of circumcising depended on Abram’s obedience. God would bless as Abram obeyed God by circumcising his household. This blessing would be in the form of multiplying Abram’s descendants over and above what he had already promised.  God then encourages his faith by changing their names from Abram (father of many) to Abraham (father of multitudes) and from Sari (my princess) to Sarah (royal princess). \n\n1. What new information did Abraham learn about God's covenant with him?\n2. Why do you think circumcision was God’ sign of choice?\n3. Why were God’s consequences for not being circumcised so harsh?\n\n**Gen 17:15-18:15 – God fulfills the promise in his own good time.**\n\nAfter 13 years of silence Abraham undoubtedly assumed Ishmael would be the promised heir. Hearing the news that Sarah would be the one through whom the promise would continue warranted the laugh of surprise and joy on his part. Considering all the new information we read about in this chapter, the revelation of Sarah becoming a mother is the most significant part of these two chapters. In this next encounter with God, Sarah hears the prophecy concerning Isaac for herself. This new information made Sarah laugh in disbelief. However, this laugh prompted the Lord to declare that nothing would be too difficult for him. By declaring when the baby would be born, the Lord let Abraham and Sarah in on more details of the promise, thus strengthening their faith in God. The circumstances in which God chooses to work in this story build the anticipation of Isaac’s birth, and emphasize God’s supernatural power at work to fulfill his divine promises.\n\n1. What were the circumstances that lead to Sarah laughing in disbelief?\n2. Why do you think God promised to bless Ishmael as well Isaac?\n3. How is Abraham’s faith demonstrated in this chapter?\n\n=======\n\n+++++++\n\n**Romans 4:9-12 – The gift of righteousness comes before obedience.**\n\nThe book of Romans is the definitive book about the righteousness of God on the basis of faith in Christ alone. In this passage Paul is refuting the argument that one needed to obey the law of Moses in order to be saved. To defend his point Paul points to God’s divine timeline in the life of Abraham. God counted Abraham righteous on the basis of faith many years before he established the covenant of circumcision. This timeline acts as evidence to show the reader that the righteousness of Christ is offered on the basis of faith alone. obedience then, is what subsequently follows true faith in Christ, and not the other way around. Paul also makes it clear that circumcision had no value in making anyone righteous before God. Paul in no way speaks against circumcision, but rather shows that there is no prerequisite step to receive the righteousness of God beyond simple faith in Jesus Christ. \n\n1. Why is the timeline of Abraham’s circumcision so important for Jews and Gentiles today? \n2. What are signs and customs that give people a false sense of righteousness in our church culture?\n3. How does it look like for you to “walk in the footsteps of faith” that our father Abraham had?\n\n$$$$$$$",

The pent-up hurt and anger bursting through the walls she had built over the last few months. Hearing her sobs, Abram entered the tent and gently embraced her. “Is this how our life is to be now? My own servant has dishonored me because of my barrenness. I am humiliated!” Sarai pulled away from him and shouted, “This is your fault! You give her so much attention. I am the one who sacrificially gave her to you and now I am the one suffering for it. Let Yahweh judge between you and me!”\n\n“Sarai, this was your idea. You gave Hagar to me so she could bear a child for you. The attention I give her is only for the child I have waited so long for,” her husband said, trying to reason with her. But it did little to help, she only cried harder with the reminder of what she had gotten herself into. \n\n“I was merely trying to help Yahweh fulfill his promise to you,” she explained. Hagar was only supposed to carry the child for me, but now I feel pushed out of my place as your wife. Perhaps, I am the one in the way. You are supposed to be the father of a great nation, yet I am barren. It seems the Lord has no use for me. I almost got you killed in Egypt and have only brought you trouble, I should have stayed there,” she told him, with a look of defeat.\n\nAbram gently turned Sarai, lifting her chin so he could look into her eyes. “Sarai, you are my wife.  You are to be the mother of my children, whether they come from Hagar or your own womb. Yahweh has chosen you. Why else would he send plagues on Egypt in order to force Pharaoh to return you to me?” he said wiping her eyes with the back of his hand. “He is your shield as well as mine.”\n\nSarai nodded. “You are right, Abram, but I don’t know if I can live with the contempt Hagar shows me. She has the other women mocking me as well. They think I don’t hear them, but I do.”\n\nAbram folded his arms around her, “Perhaps we have disobeyed the Lord in bringing Hagar into this. He has been silent for ten years now,” he said, reflecting on all that had happened. “Well, Sarai, she is your servant. You may do to her as you please,” he said, trying to forget the fact that Hagar was carrying his one and only son. \n\nWeeks went by, as Abram watched his wife inwardly battle her servant. Hagar’s contempt continued and Sarai’s patience was quickly wearing out. One morning, Hagar emerged from her tent well after the sun had risen. She rubbed her eyes as Sarai and the other women walked past her, carrying water from the well. Sarai stopped, setting her jug of water down, she said, “Hagar, you are pregnant, not ill. You should be helping us.”\n\nHagar just sneered at Sarah with defiance and said, “What are you going to do, beat me? I am Abram’s wife and carrying his only child. You wouldn’t dare!”\n\n“Why are you treating me this way, Hagar? Since I brought you out of Egypt, you have been my most trustworthy servant and friend. But since I gave you to Abram, you only treat me with ridicule.”\n\nHagar smirked, unrattled by her mistress’ claims, “Did you think I was your friend?” she chuckled. “The moment I met you, I knew you were never going to have children. You are a barren woman! Everyone knew that you would eventually pick a servant to carry Abram’s child, after all, he has to live up to his name. I just seized the opportunity, by becoming your closest friend.”\n\nA tear rolled down Sarai’s stone-cold face. “So, you became my friend so I would choose you to carry Abram’s child?” Sarai said between gritted teeth. \n\n“It’s sad that you are only figuring that out now,” Hagar replied. Sarai’s anger erupted. She picked up her jug of water and threw it at Hagar, drenching her from head to toe. “You beast!” she shouted. “Get out! Get out!” Sarai commanded, throwing the clay pot, hitting Hagar in the middle of the back. Hagar fell to her knees in shock at her mistress’s outburst. She watched as Sarai grabbed a large stick ready to beat her, Hagar stumbled to her feet and took off at a run, fleeing from Sarai. She ran until the tents of Abram were out of sight.\n\nJourneying south, Hagar traveled for days, heading towards her home of Egypt, the only place she knew to go. Hunger being the least of her worries, dangerous men and wild animals were her greatest threat, not to mention lack of water.  She had almost reached the wilderness of Shur when she collapsed by a spring. The baby in her womb had slowed from lack of water. She could no longer feel his movements. She drank heavily and rested in the small oasis she had discovered. Wounded physically and emotionally, she wondered if she should even move on. She had been abused her entire life by others. This was nothing new. Sarai should have known that a girl like her would only want to improve her position in life by any means possible. Sarai had been the only mistress to treat her respectfully, until she had betrayed her trust. Now she was alone as ever. \n\nUnloved, mistreated, exploited, uncared for, sobs racked her body as the walls she had built up over the years to protect herself came crumbling down. Her situation was forcing herself to come face to face with the reality of her position in life. She was alone with no one to love and no one to return that love. Who was this God Abram worshipped? He promised to bless his offspring, yet here she was with his child, perishing in the desert. \n\nSuddenly, not far from where she crouched by the spring, the bushes rustled, startling Hagar. Then out stepped a man, but the man was no ordinary man, he was dressed in brilliant white, and light seemed to surround him. Frightened, she tried to hide in the brush, but the stranger continued towards her as if she were the one he was searching for. “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?” he asked.\n\n“I am fleeing from my mistress, Sarai,” she answered, hesitantly. Uncertain of how to explain what happened, “She hurt me! So, I ran away,” she blurted out, bursting into tears. \n\n“Return to your mistress and submit to her,” he commanded. Hagar nodded; her head hung low. \n\n“Yes, I have dishonored her,” she confessed. \n\nThen the angel of the Lord, crouched down near her and, taking her hand, said, “I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered.”\n\nHagar looked up to see his eyes which seemed to pierce straight through her. “I will no longer be alone?” she asked.\n\n“Behold, you are pregnant and shall bear a son. You shall call his name Ishmael, because the Lord has listened to your affliction. He shall be a wild donkey of a man, his hand against everyone and everyone’s hand against him, and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.”\n\nHope filled Hagar and she said, “You are a God of seeing. You have seen my affliction and cared for me.”\nThe angel of the Lord smiled, stood and walked out of the brush as quickly as he had entered. Hagar remained by the spring, paralyzed by emotions she had never expereinced before. She felt loved and comforted while peace and hope spring up in her heart. \n\n“I will call this spring Beer-lahai-roi, since this is where I saw the One who looks after me,” she said aloud, as she stood to prepare her journey back to Sarai.\n\nBoth Abram and Sarai greeted Hagar when she returned. “Forgive me, Mistress, I have disgraced you,” she said, kneeling before Sarai. Sarai took Hagar’s hands and lifted her to feet and embraced her. Then, Hagar turned to Abram and said, “I have seen your God, El Roi. He has looked after me.”\n\nThat spring, Hagar bore Abram a son, and he named him Ishmael. Thirteen years passed as Ishmael grew into a man under the care of his father. All the while, Abram continued to wait on the Lord, wondering if Ishmael would be the promised heir, but God remained silent. It was not until was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared. His appearance was unlike the others. He came to Abram and with a booming voice like many waters and said, “I am El Shaddai, God Almighty, walk before me and be blameless, that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you greatly.” \n\nFrightened, Abram fell on his face as God continued, “Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations. No longer will you be called Abram, the exalted father, your name shall now be Abraham, father of a multitude, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings shall come from you. I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you. And I will give to you and all your children the land where you have traveled, the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.”  \n\nAbraham dared not raise his face, this was an encounter like no other. Was this a confirmation of all the Lord had promised him and he had waited for? Yet it seemed that the promise was even bigger than he had imagined. But his thoughts were cut off as God continued.\n\n“As for you, Abraham, you shall keep my covenant, you and your children and your children’s children. This is the agreement I am making with you in which you and your offspring are to keep: you are to be circumcised as a sign of the covenant between me and you. Every male from your household who is eight days and older shall be circumcised, your servants included. But every man who refuses to be circumcised, shall be cut off from his people, for he has broken my covenant.”\n\nAbraham slowly raised his head as he heard the Lord’s instruction. “As for Sarai your wife, her name shall now be Sarah, royal princess. I will bless her, and I will give you a son by her. Her children will become many nations and kings shall come from her.”\n\nOverjoyed with this news, Abraham let out a laugh that escaped from deep inside him where years of repressed shame, anxiety, and hopelessness had dwelled over his wife’s condition. He asked himself if this could be true. Could a man at one hundred years old have a child? Could Sarah carry a baby at the age of ninety? How could this be? He already had a living son. “Oh, that Ishmael might live before you and be my heir,” Abraham stated almost as a question.\n\n“No, Abraham,” the Lord said firmly. “Sarah, your wife, shall bear you a son and you shall call his name Isaac, which means, laughter. I will establish my everlasting covenant with him and his offspring. As for Ishmael, he is not forgotten, for I have heard you. I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly. He shall father twelve princes and I will make him into a great nation. But my covenant is with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this time next year.”\n\nExcitement rose within Abraham as he lifted his head. Yahweh had vanished, in his wake left Abraham shaken, overwhelmed, but nevertheless full of joy and anticipation for what was to come. However, obedience must be his focus in the moment. The Lord had instructed him to circumcise every male in his household. Apprehension creeped through his insides at the thought the procedure and recovery time for a man of his age. Nevertheless, that same afternoon, he sharpened his tools and called his son Ishmael. Abraham circumcised his thirteen-year-old son and then gathered his servants and every man that belonged in this household, not one man was left uncircumcised that day, including Abraham himself. Despite the pain and complete helplessness, Abraham fell asleep that night in a cloud of contentment knowing that, because of his faith, the gift of righteousness promised to him by Yahweh, had been sealed in his circumcision. He would carry this sign with him his whole life and pass it to his children. His only prayer was for a legacy of faith carried by Ishmael and his future son Isaac. \nWeeks went by as the days grew warmer and Abraham continued with his slow recovery. On one particular hot afternoon, Abraham sat down outside his tent in the shade. He rested his eyes, closing them against the dry heat of the sun. He had begun to drift off to sleep, when a feeling of urgency came over him. Suddenly, he opened his eyes to see three men dressed as travelers. His heart skipped a beat when he recognized his Lord. Quickly, he got to his feet and ran to them, bowing down, he said, “Oh Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do me the honor of resting here as my guest. Let me bring a little water to wash your feet while you rest under this tree. I will bring you some bread to refresh yourselves and after that you may continue on your way.”\n\nThe men looked at one another and nodded, “Yes, we will stay.”\n\nGrinning, Abraham took off at a run back to the tent. “Sarah! Sarah!” he frantically called out. “Quick, get some of our finest flour and make some cakes. We have guests!”\n\nLooking a bit flustered, Sarah, peeked through the fold of the tent, curious over these guests who had caused her husband to be so animated. She saw three worn out looking travelers sitting under the tree. Shrugging, she called Hagar and got to work kneading and rolling out dough.\n\nMeanwhile, Abraham had rushed over to the herd of cattle and chose the best calf he could find. Calling to the herdsman, he said, “Here, take this calf and prepare it as quickly as you can for our guests.” As soon as the calf had been cooked and prepared, Abraham took it with some curds and milk to his guests and joined them under the tree while they ate. \n\n“Where is Sarah your wife,” one of them asked. \n\n“She is in the tent with the women,” Abraham answered, wondering what interest they had in Sarah.\n\n“I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah, your wife, shall have a son,” Yahweh said, smiling at Abraham. \n\nFrom behind them, Sarah had returned to the fold in the tent listening to these three strange travelers. Surprised by the mention of her name, she wondered if she had ever encountered them before. Her interest peaked, she listened closer. “A baby!” she said to herself, laughing inside. “After Abraham and I are old and worn out, beyond childbearing age, shall I now have the pleasure of motherhood?” \n\n“Why did Sarah laugh at this news?” The Lord asked Abraham. Abraham was speechless, he hadn’t heard his wife laugh and realized she must have been listening from inside the tent. \n\n“Sarah, come and join us,” Abraham called to her. Realizing that she had been caught eavesdropping, Sarah timidly emerged from the tent.\n\nWho was this man, she asked herself as she joined them under the tree? He knows my inner thoughts. “Why did you laugh Sarah? Is anything too hard for the Lord?” Yahweh asked her. \n\nFrightened, Sarah denied it saying, “I didn’t laugh.”\n\n“No, but you did, Sarah,” the Lord gently corrected her. “At the appointed time I will return to you, about this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son.”\n\nSarah smiled, as faith in his words began to grow and bring hope. \n\n**Circumcision was merely a sign of Abraham’s righteousness. Before he was circumcised, it was faith that brought Abraham into a right relationship with God. Those who have faith like Abraham’s are brought into Abraham’s blessing, regardless if they are circumcised or uncircumcised.**",
